<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

<p>The author was asked in 1908 by the
Lynn Commission on Industrial Education
to make an investigation of European shoe
schools and to assist the Commission in
preparing a course of study for the proposed
shoe school in the city of Lynn. A close
investigation showed that there were several
textbooks on shoemaking published in
Europe, but that no general textbook on
shoemaking had been issued in this country
adapted to meet the needs of industrial,
trade, and commercial schools or those who
have just entered the rubber, shoe, and
leather trades. This book is written to meet
this need. Others may find it of interest.</p>

<p>The author is under obligations to the
following persons and firms for information
and assistance in preparing the book, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>

<h1>SHOEMAKING</h1>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_ONE">CHAPTER ONE<br />
<span class="smaller">FUNDAMENTAL SHOE TERMS</span></h2>

<p>Before explaining the manufacture of
shoes, it is necessary to fix definitely in
our minds the names of their different parts.
Examine your shoes and note the parts that
are here described.</p>

<p>The bottom of the shoe is called the sole.
The part above the sole is called the upper.
The top of the shoe is that part measured
by the lacing which covers the ankle and
the instep. The vamp is that section which
covers the sides of the foot and the toes.
The shank is that part of the sole of the shoe
between the heel and the ball. This name
is often applied to a piece of metal or other
substance in that part of the sole, intended
to give support to the arch of the foot. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
throat of the vamp is that part which curves
around the lower edge of the top, where
the lacing starts.</p>

<p>Backstay is a term used to denote a strip
of leather covering and strengthening the
back seam of the shoe. Quarter is a term
used mostly in low shoes to denote the rear
part of the upper when a full vamp is not
used. Button fly is the portion of the upper
containing the buttonholes of a button shoe.
Tip is the toe piece of a shoe, stitched to
the vamp and outside of it. The lace stay
is a term used to denote a strip of leather
reënforcing the eyelet holes. Tongue denotes
a narrow strip of leather used on all
lace shoes to protect the instep from the
lacing and weather.</p>

<p class="caption">Names of the Different Parts of Foot Wear. <i><a href="#Page_2">Page 2.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>Foxing is the name applied to leather of
the upper that extends from the sole to
the laces in front, and to about the height
of the counter in the back, being the length
of the upper. It may be in one or more
pieces, and is often cut down to the shank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
in circular form. If in two pieces, that part
covering the counter is called a heel fox.
Overlay is a term applied to leather attached
to the upper part of the vamp of a slipper.
The breast of the heel is the inner part of
the heel, that is, the section nearest the
shank.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_TWO">CHAPTER TWO<br />
<span class="smaller">HIDES AND THEIR TREATMENT</span></h2>

<p>If we examine our shoes, we will find
that the different parts are composed of
material called leather. The bottom of the
shoe is of hard leather, while the part above
the sole is of a softer, more pliable leather.
This leather is nothing more than the hides
of different animals treated in such a way
as to remove the fat and the hair.</p>

<p>After the hides have been taken from the
dead body of the animal, they are quite
heavily salted to preserve them from spoiling.
In this salted condition they are
shipped to the tanneries.</p>

<p>The process or series of processes by
which the hides and skins of animals are
converted into leather is called tanning.
The process may be divided into three
groups of subprocesses as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Beamhouse process, which removes the
hair from the hides and prepares them for
the actual process of the tanning or conversion
into leather; tanning, which converts
the raw hide into leather; and finishing,
which involves a number of operations, the
objects of which are to give the leather the
color that may be desired and also to make
it of uniform thickness, and impart to it the
softness and the finish that is required for
a particular purpose.</p>

<p>Hides are divided roughly in the tannery,
according to the size, into three general
classes:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) Hides, skins from fully grown animals,
as cows, oxen, horses, buffaloes, walrus,
etc. These are thick, heavy leather, used
for shoe soles, large machinery belting,
trunks, etc., where stiffness, strength, and
wearing qualities are desired. The untanned
hides weigh from twenty-five to
sixty pounds.</p>

<p>(2) Kips, skins of the undersized animals<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
of the above group, weighing between
fifteen and twenty-five pounds.</p>

<p>(3) Skins from small animals, such as
calves, sheep, goats, dogs, etc. This last
group gives a light, but strong and pliable
leather, which may be used for a great many
purposes, such as men’s shoes and the
heavier grades of women’s shoes.</p>

<p>The hides, kips, and skins are divided into
various grades, according to their weight,
size, condition, and quality.</p>

<p>The quality of the hides not only depends
upon the kind of animal, but also upon its
fodder and mode of living. The hides of
wild cattle yield a more compact and stronger
leather than those of our domesticated
beasts. Among these latter the stall-fed have
better hides than the meadow-fed, or grazing
cattle. The thickness of the hide varies
considerably on different animals and on the
parts of the body, the thickest part of the
bull being near the head and the middle of
the back, while at the belly the hide is thinnest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
These differences are less conspicuous
in sheep, goats, and calves. As regards
sheep, it would appear that their skin is
generally thinnest where their wool is longest.</p>

<p>In the raw, untanned state, and with
the hair still on, the hides are termed
“green” or “fresh.” Fresh, or green hides
are supplied to the tanners by the packers
or the butchers, or are imported, either dry
or salted.</p>

<p>Hides are obtained either from the regular
packing houses or from farmers who
kill their own stock, and do not skin the
animal as scientifically as the regular packing
houses, in which case they are called
country hides. There are different grades
of hides and leather, and these different
grades are divided in the commercial world
into the five following grades:&mdash;</p>

<p>Hides obtained from steers raised on
Western farms are known as native steer
hides.</p>

<p>Native cowhide (heavy) is hide weighing
from fifty-five to sixty-five pounds, obtained
from cows.</p>

<p>Native cowhide (light) is cowhide weighing
under fifty-five pounds.</p>

<p>Branded cowhide is hide obtained from
cows that are branded on the face of the
hide.</p>

<p>Butts is a term applied to the part of the
hide remaining after cutting off the head,
shoulders, and strip of the belly.</p>

<p>Colorado steer hide is from Colorado
steers, which are very light.</p>

<p>Texas steer hide comes in three grades,
heavy, light, and extra light. The heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
grade is very heavy because the animal is
allowed to graze on the plains. That is the
reason why it is heavier than the Colorado
steer hide, which is raised on the farm.</p>

<p>Bull hide is divided into two classes, the
regular hide and the branded grade. The
branded grade usually is one cent a pound
less than the regular.</p>

<p>Country hides are of three grades, Ohio
Buffs, Ohio Ex., and Southern. The Ohio
Buffs weigh from forty to sixty pounds.
The Ohio Ex. weighs from twenty to forty
pounds. Southern hides have spots without
hair and other blemishes on them, due to
the sting of insects. This makes the
Southern hide inferior to the Ohio, Indiana,
Michigan, and Chicago hides that have no
such blemishes. Ohio Butt hides are the
best, because in Ohio they kill a great many
young calves, while in Chicago young cows
(that have calved) are killed, causing the
hide to be flanky.</p>

<p>The season of the year in which cattle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
are slaughtered has considerable influence
upon both the weight and condition of the
hide. During the winter months, by reason
of the hair being longer and thicker, the hide
is heavier, ranging from seventy-five to
eighty pounds, and gradually decreasing
in weight as the season becomes warmer
and the coat is shed, until in June and
July it weighs from seventy down to fifty-five
pounds, the hair then being thin and
short. The best hides of the year are
October hides, and short-haired hides are
better for leather purposes than long-haired
ones.</p>

<p>A thick hide which is to be used for
upper leather is cut into sides before the
tanning process is completed. This is
performed by passing it between rollers
where it comes in contact with a sharp
knife-edge, which splits it into two or more
sheets. Great care must be exercised in
cutting the leather in order to have good
“splits” (sheets of leather). A split from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
a heavy hide is not as good as a whole of a
lighter leather.</p>

<p>Butts and backs are selected from the
stoutest and heaviest oxhides. The butt
is formed by cutting off the head, the
shoulder, and the strip of the belly. The
butt or back of oxhide forms the stoutest
and heaviest leather, such as is used for
soles of boots, harness, etc.</p>

<p class="caption">Green-Salted Calfskin. <i><a href="#Page_12">Page 12.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>Hides and skins are received at the
tannery in one of three conditions, viz.
green-salted, dry, or dry-salted. Very few
hides are received by tanners in fresh or
unsalted condition, salt being necessary to
preserve them from decay. Green-salted
hides are those that have been salted in
fresh condition, tied up in bundles, and
shipped to the tanner. Dry hides are those
that were taken from the carcass and dried
without being salted; these are usually
stiff and hard. Dry-salted hides are hides
that were heavily salted while they were
fresh, and then dried. The hides and skins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
that are received from the slaughterhouses
of this country are almost invariably green-salted;
those from foreign countries are
green-salted, dry, and dry-salted.</p>

<p>It does not matter in what condition the
hides are received or the kind of leather
into which they are to be tanned; they all
require soaking in water before any attempt
is made to remove the hair or to tan them.
The object of the soaking process, as it is
called, is to thoroughly soften the hides
and to remove from them all salt, dirt,
blood, etc. Ordinary hides are usually
soaked from twenty-four to forty-eight
hours. Dry hides require much longer.
The water should be changed once or twice
during the process, since dirty water may
injure the hides. Soft water is better than
hard for this process. Where the water is
hard, it is customary for the tanner to add
a quantity of borax to it to increase its
cleansing power and to hasten the softening
of the hides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>When dry hides have become soft enough
to bend without cracking, they are put
into a machine and beaten and rolled, then
soaked again until they are soft and pliable.
It is very important that all the salt and
dirt are removed during the process of
soaking, as they injure the quality of the
leather if they are not removed before
the hides are unhaired. When the soaking
process is completed, the lumps of fat and
flesh that may have been left on by the
butcher are removed by hand or by a
machine, and the hides are then in condition
to be passed along into the next process.
The parts that cannot be made into leather,
such as tails, teats, etc., are trimmed off
before the hides are soaked. Large hides
are cut into two pieces or halves, called
“sides,” after they have been soaked.</p>

<p>For the purpose of taking the hair from
the hides and skins, lime, sulphide of
sodium, and red arsenic are used. Lime
is sometimes used alone, but usually one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
of the other two chemicals is mixed with it.
The lime is dissolved in hot water, a quantity
of either sulphide of sodium or red
arsenic is added to it, and the solution is
then mixed with water in a vat, the hides
being immersed in this liquor until the hair
can be easily removed. The action of the
unhairing liquor is to swell the hides, then
to dissolve the perishable animal portion
and loosen the hair so that it can be rubbed
or pulled off.</p>

<p>There are several different processes of
unhairing the hides. Each tanner uses the
process that will help to give the leather
the qualities that it should have, such as
softness and pliability for shoe and glove
leather, or firmness and solidity for sole
and belting leather. This is one of the
most important in the series of tannery
processes, and if the hides are not unhaired
properly and not prepared for tanning as
they should be, the leather will not be right
when it is tanned and finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>There is also a process of unhairing, called
“sweating,” which softens the hide and
loosens the hair so that it can be scraped off.
In this process the hides begin to decay before
the hair is loose; it is therefore a dangerous
process to use and must be carefully watched
or the hides will be entirely spoiled. Sweating
is never used for the finer, softer kinds
of leather. It is applied chiefly to dry
hides for sole, lace, and belt leather. It is
an old-fashioned process and is not used as
much nowadays as some years ago.</p>

<p>The pelts of sheep are salted at the
slaughterhouses and then shipped to the
tannery. Here they are thrown into water
and left to soak twenty-four hours to
loosen the dirt and dissolve the salt. The
pelts are next passed through machines that
clean the wool, and any particles of flesh
remaining on the inner or flesh side are
removed. The pelts are then in condition
to have the wool removed. As long as a
sheepskin has the wool upon it, it is called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
a pelt; as soon as the wool has been taken
off, it is called a skin or a “slat.”</p>

<p>Each pelt is spread out smoothly on a
table with the wool down and the inner or
flesh side up. A mixture of lime and
sulphide of sodium is next applied uniformly
over the skin with a brush. The pelt is
then folded up and placed in a pile with
others. The solution that was applied
penetrates the skin and loosens the wool,
which, at the end of twenty-four hours,
more or less, can be easily pulled off with
the hands or rubbed off with a dull instrument
or stick. The workman must be
careful not to get any of the solution on to
the wool, as it dissolves it and makes it
worthless. Since the wool is valuable, the
solution must be applied to the flesh side
very carefully so that it does no injury.
The wool that is removed from the skins is
called “pulled wool.”</p>

<p>The slat is now ready to be limed, washed,
pickled, and tanned. Heavy skins are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
often split into two sheets after they have
been limed. The part from the wool side
is called a skiver, and that from the flesh
side is called a flesher.</p>

<p>After the skins have been limed, they are
bated and washed, which makes them soft,
clean, and white; they are then put into a
solution of salt, sulphuric acid, and water,
called “pickle,” and after a few hours they
are taken out, drained, and tanned.</p>

<p>Large quantities of sheepskins are sold
to tanners in the pickled condition by those
who make a business of preparing such
skins and selling the wool. Pickled skins
can be kept an indefinite length of time
without spoiling; they can also be dried
and worked out into a cheap white leather
without any further tanning whatever.
Most of such skins, however, are sold to
tanners, who tan them into leather. Sheepskins
contain considerable grease, which
must be removed before the leather can be
sold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>For some processes of tanning, calfskins,
goatskins, and cattle hides are also pickled
the same as sheepskins; for other processes
they are not pickled, but are thoroughly
bated or delimed, washed, and cleansed.
Heavy hides are sometimes split out of the
lime; more frequently, however, they are
not split until after they have been tanned.</p>

<p>To capitulate, the preparatory processes
may be briefly described as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Soaking, which dissolves the salt, removes
the dirt and makes the hides soft and
comparatively clean.</p>

<p>Liming and unhairing, which swell the
hides and dissolve the perishable animal
portion, loosen the hair, and put the hides
into proper condition for tanning. Hides
tanned without liming, even if the hair is
removed by some chemical, do not make
pliable leather, but are stiff and hard.</p>

<p>Bating, which removes the lime from the
hides.</p>

<p>Pickling, which helps in the tanning later,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
and keeps the hides and skins from spoiling
if they are not tanned at once.</p>

<p>The lumps of fat and flesh that may be on
the hides are removed by machinery or by
placing the hide over a beam and scraping it
with a knife. The hair, when it is loosened
by the lime, is removed by a machine or by
hand.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_THREE">CHAPTER THREE<br />
<span class="smaller">PROCESSES OF TANNING</span></h2>

<p>The various processes of tanning may
be roughly divided into two classes,
vegetable chemical and mineral chemical.
The first class is often spoken of in tanneries
simply as the “vegetable” while the second
is called “chemical” process. In the vegetable
processes the tanning is accomplished
by tannin, which is found in various barks
and woods of trees and leaves of plants. In
the so-called chemical processes the tanning
is done with mineral salts and acids which
produce an entirely different kind of leather
from that procured by vegetable tanning.</p>

<p>There is also a method of tanning, or,
more properly speaking, tawing, in which
alum and salt are used. This process
makes white leather that is used for many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
purposes; it is also colored and used in
the manufacture of fine gloves. Leather
is also made by tanning skins with oil.
Chamois skins are made in this way.</p>

<p>The materials that are used to tan hides
and skins act upon the hide fibers in such
a way that the hides are rendered proof
against decay and become pliable and strong.
There are many vegetable tans; they are
used for sole leather, upper leather, and
colored leather for numerous purposes.
The bark of hemlock trees is one of the
principal tans. The woods and barks
of oak, chestnut, and quebracho trees
are often used. Palmetto roots yield a
good tan. Large quantities of leather are
treated with gambier and various other
tanning materials that come from foreign
countries. Sumac leaves, which are imported
from Sicily, contain tannin that
makes soft leather suitable for hat sweatbands,
suspender trimmings, etc. Sumac
is also obtained from the State of Virginia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
but the foreign leaves contain more tannin
and make better leather than the
American.</p>

<p>To a large extent the so-called chemical
processes have supplanted the vegetable
processes, that is, old tan bark and sumac
processes; but in some tanneries both
methods are used on different kinds of
skins.</p>

<p>In the old bark process the tan bark is
ground coarse and is then treated in leaches
with hot water until the tanning quality is
drawn out. The liquor so obtained is used
at various strengths as needed.</p>

<p>In the newer method the tan liquor is
displaced by a solution of potassium bichromate,
which produces its results with much
less expenditure of time.</p>

<p>When the hides or skins are ready for
the tanning process, they are put into a
revolving drum, known as a “pinwheel,”
or into a pit in which are revolving paddles,
with a dilute solution of potassium dichromate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
or sodium dichromate, acidified with
hydrochloric or sulphuric acid. If the pinwheel
is employed, it is revolved for seven
hours or longer; after which time the
liquor is drawn off and replaced by an
acidified solution of sodium thiosulphate or
bisulphite, and then the revolution is continued
several hours longer. If the pit is
used, the skins are removed to another
drum containing the second solution, and
kept at rest or overturned for a like period.</p>

<p>In removing the skins from the pinwheel
or vat, and in handling them after treatment
with lime for the loosening of the hair, the
hands and arms of the workmen are seriously
injured, becoming raw if not protected by
rubber gloves; even with gloves it is difficult
to prevent injury, and in some establishments
the workmen are relieved by
the substitution of a single-bath process,
in which the liquor is less harmful to the
skin.</p>

<p class="caption">Tanning Process</p>
<p class="caption">Showing the vats, the unhairing and liming processes. <i><a href="#Page_24">Page 24.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>The hides are then removed from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
pits, washed and brushed, followed by slow
drying in the air. When partly dried, they
are placed in a pile and covered until heating
is induced. They are then dampened
and rolled with brass rollers to give the
leather solidity. Sole leather is oiled but
little. Weight is increased by adding glucose
and salt.</p>

<p>Various rapid processes of tanning have
been devised in which the hides are suspended
in strong liquors or are tanned in
large revolving drums. It is claimed that
this hastens the process, but the product
has been criticized as lacking substance or
being brittle.</p>

<p>Chrome tannage has been chiefly developed
in this country during the last twenty
years and is now in general use. It consists
in throwing an insoluble chromium hydroxide
or oxide on the fibers of a skin which
has been impregnated with a soluble chromium
salt&mdash;potassium bichromate. Other
salts like basic chromium chloride, chromium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
chromate, and chromic alum are also used.
The hydrochloric or sulphuric acid acts
by setting free chromic acid.</p>

<p>After several hours, the skin shows a
uniform yellow when cut through its thickest
part. It is then drained and the skin
worked in a solution of sodium bisulphite
and mineral acid (to free sulphur dioxide).
The chromic acid is absorbed by the fiber
and later reduced by sulphur dioxide.</p>

<p>In the making of chrome black leather
each tanner has his own method. Contrary
to the general belief, there are many different
methods of chrome tannage. No two tanneries
employ just the same process.</p>

<p>Tanners of chrome leather seek to produce
leather suitable for the particular
demands made upon it by the peculiarities
or characteristics of the varying seasons.
Summer shoes require a cool, light leather;
at other times a heavier tannage is essential,
with some call for a practically waterproof
product.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>All leathers, whether vegetable-or chrome-tanned,
must be “fat liquored.” That is
to say, a certain amount of fatty material
must be put into the skin in order that it
may be mellow, workable, and serviceable.
This is very essential in producing calf
leather. Fat liquors usually contain oil
and soap, which have been boiled in water
and made into a thin liquor. The leather
is put into a drum with the hot fat liquor;
the drum is set in motion, and as it revolves
the leather tumbles about in the drum and
absorbs the oil and soap from the water.
It is the fat liquor that makes the leather
soft and strong.</p>

<p>Leather used in shoes is divided into two
classes: sole leather and upper leather.</p>

<p>Sole leather is a heavy, solid, stiff leather
and may be bent without cracking. It is
the foundation of the shoe, and therefore
should be of the best material. The hides
of bulls and oxen yield the best leather for
this purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The hide that is tanned for sole leather is
soaked for several days in a weak solution
(which is gradually made stronger) of oak or
hemlock tan made from the bark. Oak-tanned
hide is preferred and may be known
by its light color. A chemical change takes
place in the fiber of the hide. This is a
high-grade tannage, and is distinguished
principally by its fine fibers and close,
compact texture.</p>

<p>Oak sole leather, by reason of its tough
character, and its close, fibrous texture,
resists water and will wear well down
before cracking. It is by many considered
better than other leather for flexible-sole
shoes, requiring waterproof qualities.</p>

<p>Sole leather is divided into three classes
according to the tanning&mdash;oak, hemlock,
and union.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus5" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/illus5.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Tanning Process</p>
<p class="caption">Showing the rotating drums. <i>See <a href="#Page_24">page 24</a>.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Oak tanning is as follows: the hides are
hung in pits containing weak or nearly
spent liquors from a previous tanning, and
agitated so as to take up tannin evenly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Strong liquor would harden the surface
so as to prevent thorough penetration into
the interior of the hides. After ten or
twelve days, the hides are taken out and
laid away in fresh tan and stronger liquor.
This process is repeated as often as necessary
for eight to ten months. At the end of this
time the hide has absorbed all of the tannin
which it will take up.</p>

<p>Hemlock tanning is similar to the oak
tanning in process. The hemlock tan is a
red shade. Hemlock produces a very hard
and inflexible leather. It is modified by
use of bleaching materials which are applied
to the leather after being tanned. It is sold
in sides without being trimmed, while the
oak is sold in backs, with belly and head
trimmed off.</p>

<p>Hemlock leather is used extensively and
almost principally for men’s and boys’
stiff-soled, heavy shoes, where no flexibility
is required or expected. Its principal desirable
quality is its resistance to trituration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
or being ground to a powder, and its use in
men’s and boys’ pegged, nailed, or standard
screw shoes is not in any way objectionable
to the wearer. In fact, for this class of
shoes, it is probably the best leather that
can be used. But when hemlock is used
in men’s and boys’ Goodyear welt shoes,
where a flexible bottom is expected and
required, it generally does not give good
results. It cannot satisfactorily resist the
constant flexing to which it is subjected,
and after the sole is worn half through, the
constant bending causes it to crack crosswise.
On this account it becomes like a
sieve, and has no power of resistance in
water, and therefore it is not at all suited
to flexible-bottomed shoes.</p>

<p>In “union-tanned” hides, both oak and
hemlock are used and the result is a compromise
in both color and quality. This
tan was first used about fifty years ago.
Twenty-five years ago the union leather
tanners began to experiment with bleaching<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
materials to avoid the use of oak bark,
which was becoming scarce and high priced,
and eventually developed a system of tanning
union leather with hemlock or kindred
tanning agents, excluding oak. The red
color and the hard texture were modified
by bleaching the leather to the desired
color and texture. This produces leather
which has not the fine, close tannage of
genuine oak leather and at the same time
lacks the compact, hard character of hemlock
leather. Union leather produced in
this manner is a sort of mongrel or hybrid
leather, being neither oak nor hemlock.
On account of its economy in cutting
qualities, however, it is largely used in the
manufacture of medium-priced shoes where
a certain degree of flexibility is required in
the sole. This is particularly true of women’s
shoes.</p>

<p>Union leather is sold largely in backs and
trimmed the same as oak, though not so
closely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Sole leather is also made nowadays by
tanning the hides by the chrome or chemical
process. This leather is very durable
and pliable and is used on athletic and sporting
shoes. It has a light green color and
is much lighter in weight than the oak or
hemlock leather.</p>

<p>Many kinds of hide are used for sole
leather. This country does not produce
nearly enough hides for the demand, and
great quantities are imported from abroad,
although most of the imported hides come
from South America. Imported hides are
divided into two general classes, dry hides
and green-salted hides.</p>

<p>Dry hides are of two kinds, the dry
“flint,” which are dried carefully after
being taken from the animal and cured
without salt. These generally make good
leather, although if sunburnt, the leather is
not strong. “Dry-salted hides” are salted
and cured to a dry state. Dry hides of
both kinds are used for hemlock leather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
only, although all hemlock leather is not
made from dry hides.</p>

<p>Green-salted hides are used in making
oak-tanned leather as well as hemlock, and
those used by United States tanners come
largely from domestic points; but there is a
variable amount imported each year from
abroad, principally from Europe and South
America. Green-salted hides are of two
general classes, those branded and those
free of brands.</p>

<p>Cow and steer hides of the branded type
are used by tanners of oak and union leather.
Those not branded are used more largely for
belting and upholstering leathers, a small
part finding their way into hemlock leather.</p>

<p>Sole leather remnants, strictly speaking,
include such a wide variety of items that
it is difficult to cover them all. Few people,
however, realize the big range of usefulness
of this class of stock. While not exactly a
by-product, remnants are often classed as
such. Under the class of sole leather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
remnants are included sole leather offal,
such as heads, bellies, shoulders, shanks,
shins, men’s heeling, men’s half heeling,
men’s and women’s three-and four-piece
heeling, etc. Stock that cannot be used
in the shoe business goes into the chemical
and fertilizer trade, among other outlets.
By a special acid process of burning this
stock, ammonia is derived from it, which
goes into fertilizer; and another by-product
is sulphuric acid for the chemical trade.
The amount of ammonia obtained is small,
being about seven per cent of ammonia to
a ton of sole leather scrap. This is mixed
with fertilizer and sold mostly in the Southern
States, and to a small extent in the West,
there being a law in many of the Western

<p class="caption">Sole Leather Offal</p>
<p class="caption">Showing bellies, shoulders, etc. <i><a href="#Page_35">Page 35.</a></i></p>
</div>

<p>In the disposition of offal, heads are used
for taps, top lifts, and under lifts. Shoulders
are used for outsoles and inner soles, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
bellies are used for medium to heavy taps
and counters. Lightweight bellies and
shanks are utilized for making box toes
and counters.</p>

<p>Shanks are also used for taps and under
lifts. This stock is solid and substantial
and well suited for these purposes. The
bellies, being flexible, are the best part of
the hide obtainable for inner soles.</p>

<p>In cutting out soles, the manufacturer
accumulates a considerable quantity of
solid or center pieces, which are used for
small top lifts, also for “Cuban” tops,
thereby using up the bulk of the small
heavy scrap that ordinarily would be sold
for pieced heeling. There is also a demand
for similar stock from the hardware trade,
where it is used for making mallet and tool
handles, also for wagon and carriage
washers. Large quantities of men’s and
women’s heeling and half heeling go to
England, where it is cut up by heel manufacturers
into lifts and sectional lifts for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
the English trade; there being a shortage
of this class of offal there.</p>

<p>The shoe manufacturer, after cutting his
soles and taps, is obliged to skive them to
get the particular iron he needs. This
leaves what is known as a “flesh sole
shape,” also a “tap shape.” These skivings
are pasted together by another class of
trade and again used for inner soling and
taps in the cheaper grades of shoes. Smaller
skivings, or waste, after sorting out the sole
and tap shapes, are sold to the leather
board trade. This eventually comes back
to the shoe trade in the shape of leather
board and is cut into heel lifts. The waste
after cutting heel lifts is again resold to
the leather board trade and makes another
round trip to the shoe manufacturer. This
illustration, as well as many others in the
leather remnant business, demonstrates the
scientific principle that nothing is ever
entirely lost. In regard to pieced heel lifts,
these are made in either two, three, or four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
sections. This refers to what are known as
sectional heel lifts. Scrap leather is also
used for shanking for the European trade.</p>

<p>Soles and taps, known as rejects, that is,
those thrown out by the high-grade trade,
are sold to manufacturers of cheaper lines.
A shoe manufacturer cutting his own soles
and buying sole leather in sides, after sorting
out the soles suited to his own requirements,
will sell what he cannot use to remnant
dealers, who in turn re-sell them to shoe
manufacturers requiring that particular
class of stock. The scrap leather, or remnant
dealer, thus forms a useful link in the
chain of distribution, furnishing a market
where shoe and leather manufacturers may
dispose of their surplus products to best
advantage, and providing a source of supply
for buyers who wish any particular article
to suit their individual needs.</p>

<p>Upper or dressed leather is made from
kips or large calfskins. It is tanned and
finished like all other forms of leather by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
variations of the foregoing process. Thick
hides are often split thin by machinery,
and the parts retained and finished separately.
The parts of the leather from the
hair side are most valuable and are called
“grain” leather; the inner parts or “flesh
splits” are made into a variety of different
kinds of leather by waxing, oiling, and
polishing.</p>

<p>It is finished by scouring with brushes and
then rubbed with a piece of glass, which
removes creases and wrinkles and stretches
the leather. Then it is stuffed with a
mixture of oil, soap, and tallow, which is
worked into it by rolling. Various finishes
are given to leather, such as seal grain,
buff, glove grain, oil grain, satin calf,
russet, plain shoe, etc.</p>

<p>Upper leathers are blacked by rubbing with
a mixture of lampblack and oil or tallow, or
with a solution of copperas and logwood.</p>

<p>No tanning process, no matter how good
or thorough, can make firm, serviceable,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
wear-resisting leather out of all portions
of any hide, because nature made some
parts of every hide porous, spongy, and
lacking in fibrous strength.</p>

<p>Calfskins used by tanners are of several
classes. American calfskins, taken off in
the United States and Canada, are usually
sold green pelted. Farmers raise only a
small fraction of the calves born. Each
cow must produce a calf in order to insure a
maximum flow of milk. Most of the farmers
keep cows to produce milk, hence they
sell the young calves for veal and use their
skins for high-grade calf leather.</p>

<p>In European countries farmers fatten
their calves before selling them in order to
get a higher price for the veal. The skin
is not so valuable for leather as the skin
from younger calves, and it is used for
lower-value leathers.</p>

<p>Calfskin is not split. A heavier weight
skin might be. It is shaved to a uniform
thickness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Calf leather is divided into the following
classes, depending upon the finish of the
leather:&mdash;</p>

<p>Boarded calf (made in both chrome and
bark tannage).</p>

<p>Wax calf, finished on the flesh side with a
waxy, hard surface.</p>

<p>Box calf is a proprietary name. It is
boarded&mdash;rubbed with a board to raise the
grain. It is known by minute, squarelike
lines.</p>

<p>Mat calf is a dull-finished calfskin, used
more in topping.</p>

<p>Suede calf is finished on flesh side. Most
makes of suede calf are chromed, although
there are some vegetable.</p>

<p>Storm calf is a heavy skin, finished for
winter wear. Considerable oil is used in
finishing.</p>

<p>French calf is finished on flesh side.</p>

<p>Dry hides are obtained from Buenos
Ayres, where the cattle are raised on the
plains. This city exports a large quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
hides, dry, salted, and cured by smoking.
The hides of cows generally yield inferior
grain leather; but South American cowhides
may be worked for light sole leather.</p>

<p>Calves’ hides are thinner, but when well
tanned, curried, and dressed, they yield a
very soft and supple leather for boots and
shoes. They are finished with wax and
oil on the flesh side, and can also be finished
on the hair (grain of skin).</p>

<p>Calves’ skin (green salted).</p>

<p>Paris City calfskins. These are obtained
in three grades&mdash;light, medium, and heavy.</p>

<p>Light grades run from four to five,
or seven to eight pounds; medium grades
run from seven to nine pounds; heavy
grades run from nine to twelve pounds.</p>

<p>Patent leather may be made from colt,
calf, or kid skin. Coltskin is the skin of
young horses, or split skins of mature
horses.</p>

<p>Patent colt and kid are used for the most
part in the medium fine grades, and patent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
side (cowhide) is used in the medium and
cheaper grades. Chrome tanned are used entirely
in the manufacture of patent leather.</p>

<p>Patent leather, as it appears in shoes,
may be described either as varnished leather,
coltskin, or kid, and sometimes the French
use calfskin. The process is largely a
secret one, although there is no longer any
patent on the principle of the same. It is
made by shaving the skins on the flesh side
or hair side to a uniform thickness. Then
it is de-greased to put the skin in condition
to receive the finish and protect the same
from peeling off. Successive coats of liquid
black varnish are applied, the first coats
being dried and rubbed down, so as to work
the liquid thoroughly into the fibers of the
leather. The last coat is applied with a brush,
and baked to from one hundred and twenty
to one hundred and forty degrees Fahrenheit
for thirty-six hours and then allowed to dry
in direct sunlight for from six to ten hours,
which seems to be essential to remove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the sticky feeling. Various ingredients are
used in making the different varnishes, the
first coating consisting of naphtha, wood
alcohol, amyl acetate, etc. The black
varnishes consist of linseed oil and various
other mixtures, heated in iron kettles. The
final coating is a naphtha preparation resembling
japanning material. The hide is
stretched on a frame during the varnishing
operations.</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to tell the difference
in quality of shiny leather by appearance,
although in general the leather on which
the grain shows through the varnish will
prove more serviceable than that on which
the finish is so thick as to hide the grain.
Great care must be exercised in resewing
patent leather shoes that have been exposed
during the cold weather, as the cold has
a tendency to freeze the finish. Patent
leather, like all varnished coatings, is liable
to crack. No one can guarantee it not to do
so. The kid patent leather is more elastic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and porous than other kinds. The serious
objection to the use of patent leather for a
shoe is its air-tightness. This makes it both
unhygienic and uncomfortable. The kid
patent leather is the only patent leather
that has not this objection.</p>

<p>Kid is a term applied to shoe leather
made from the skins of mature goats. The
skin of the young goat or kid is made into
the thin, flexible leather used for kid gloves,
which is too delicate for general use in
shoes. The goats from which come the
supply of leather used in this country for
women’s and children’s fine shoes are not
the common, domesticated kind known in
this country, but are wild goats or allied
species partially domesticated, and are
found in the hill regions of India, the mountains
of Europe, portions of South America,
etc.</p>

<p>There are about sixty-eight recognized
kinds of goatskins that are imported from
all over the world. The Brazilian, Buenos<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Ayres, Andean, Mexican, French, Russian,
Indian, and Chinese are a few of the many
kinds that are known as such. Each
particular species of goat hide possesses
its own peculiarities of texture. The thickness
and grain differ according to the environment
in which the animal has been
raised. It is peculiar that those raised in
cold climates do not have as thick skins as
those raised in warmer climates, for the long,
thick hair apparently takes the strength.</p>

<p>We may wonder where all the skins come
from that are made up into glazed kid,
mat kid, and suede, at the rate of several
thousand dozen every day. The great proportion
of the skins are <i>goatskins</i>. These
are almost all imported from abroad, where
the animals are slaughtered and disposed of
much the same as we dispose of beef and
veal here. Sheepskins and carbarettas, the
hides of animals that are a cross between
sheep and goats, are also used.</p>

<p>The finer grades of kid and goatskins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
which are tanned in large quantities in
New England, come from the Far East.</p>

<p>In China there are two great ports from
which skins are shipped, Tientsin and
Shanghai. Back in the interior, starting
from a point about twelve hundred miles
from the sea, collectors make their rounds
twice a year.</p>

<p>The breeder of goats kills his flock just
before the collector is due, skins the animals
on the hillside, preserves the meat for food,
and with the kidskins, which have been
partly dried, wrapped in a bundle carried
upon the back, or upon a pack animal, the
breeder makes his way to the station. It
may be that there are a half hundred
breeders awaiting the coming of the collector
and he pays them the market price for the
skins.</p>

<p>Whenever the collector has a sufficient supply
to make it profitable to ship, he bales the
skins and then sends them over the thousand
mile journey along the river to the seaport.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
From Tientsin or Shanghai they are
taken by tramp steamers, which reach
Eastern ports by way of the Suez Canal,
and on the trip the steamers make several
ports, so that it is from six to ten weeks
before the skins reach America.</p>

<p>Another method of importing is to have
the raw material shipped across the Pacific
and then transferred to a railroad, but the
difference in cost to the manufacturer is so
great that it is unprofitable.</p>

<p>The China goatskins are rated as among
the finest in the world and when tanned
they make the highest-grade shoe.</p>

<p>Then there are mocha skins, which come
from Tripoli, Arabia, and Northern Africa.
In those places the method of collection is
practically the same as in China.</p>

<p>The two best-known grades are the
Hodieda and the Benghazi. They derive
their designations from the exporting cities.
Hodieda is located in the southwestern
part of Arabia on the Red Sea, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
Benghazi is in Barca, one of the provinces
of Tripoli.</p>

<p>Other goatskins are produced in India
and Russia, and millions of skins are exported
annually from Bombay, Madras, and
Calcutta. These skins are not brought
direct to America, but are transshipped at
Marseilles or London.</p>

<p>The jobbers in Europe or India occupy
rather a unique position, for according to
their practice it is almost impossible for
them to suffer financial losses in dealing
with an American tanner. The latter, when
he wishes to arrange for his year’s supply of
raw material, negotiates with an agent in
Boston, with whom he signs a contract
for so many skins. Then it is necessary for
the tanner to either purchase with money
equal to the face value or secure by loans
letters of credit from Boston banking
houses which have European connections.</p>

<p>Before the skins are exported, the jobber
has his money from the European banking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
concerns and the bills of lading are forwarded
to the Boston bankers, who turn them over
to the tanners, and, when the occasion
requires, obtain from the tanners what is
known as a deed of trust.</p>

<p>All goatskins are tanned by the same
chrome tanning process, whether the finish
is to be glazed or mat. The proportions of
chemicals vary according to the texture of
the skin, and according to the grain.</p>

<p>The process of tanning is quicker than
the tanning of heavier hides, and all varieties
of tannage are used, the chrome
methods having come into very general use.
There are many kinds of finish given, such
as glazed, dull, mat, patent, etc. One
quality that distinguishes goat leather, the
“kid” of shoemaking, is the fact that the
fibers of the skin are interlaced and interlocked
in all directions. The finished skins
as they come from the tannery, by whatever
process they may be put through, are sorted
for size and quality, a number of grades<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
being made. Instead of ripping straight
through, like a piece of cloth, or splitting
apart in layers, as sheepskin will do when
made into leather, the kid holds together
firmly in all directions.</p>

<p>Glazed kid is colored after it is tanned by
submerging it in the color, a very important
process. The glossy surface is obtained by
“striking” or burnishing on the grain side.
It is made in black and colors, particularly
tan, and is known by about as many names
as there are manufacturers of it.</p>

<p>Glazed kid is used in the uppers of shoes,
making a fine, soft shoe that is particularly
comfortable in warm weather, and is said
to prevent cold feet in winter, owing to
unrestricted circulation.</p>

<p>Mat kid is a soft, dull black kid, the
softness being the result of treatment with
beeswax or olive oil. It is finished on the
grain side the same as glazed kid, and is
used principally for shoe toppings. It is
very similar in appearance to mat calf and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
is often used in preference to it, as it is of
much lighter weight, and about as strong.</p>

<p>Suede kid is not tanned, but is subjected
to a feeding process in an egg solution,
called “tawing,” to make it soft and pliable.
The skin is stretched and the color is applied
by “brushing” (with a brush). The color
does not permeate the skin, but is merely
on the surface. Suedes are made from
carbarettas and split sheepskins. Suedes
are used very extensively in making slippers,
and come in a great variety of colors.</p>

<p>A castor kid is a Persian lambskin finished
the same as a suede, and is used in
making very soft, fine-appearing leather&mdash;like
glove leather. The skin is of such a
very light weight that it has to be “backed
up” before being made into shoes.</p>

<p>Fancy leathers are used extensively for
toppings of shoes having patent leather
vamps. Facings are selected from fancy
leathers to make the inside of a shoe attractive
and to increase its wearing quality.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
Leathers of dull or glazed finish are used in
typical shoe colors.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous kinds of kids are as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<ul>
<li><i>A.</i> Kangaroo</li>
<li><i>B.</i> Buckskin</li>
<li><i>C.</i> Sheepskin</li>
<li><i>D.</i> Chamois</li>
<li><i>E.</i> Cordovan</li>
<li><i>F.</i> Splits</li>
<li class="isub1"><i>a.</i> Seal Grain</li>
<li class="isub1"><i>b.</i> Buff</li>
<li class="isub1"><i>c.</i> Oil Grain</li>
<li class="isub1"><i>d.</i> Satin Calf</li>
<li><i>G.</i> Enamel</li>
<li><i>H.</i> Sides</li>
</ul>

<p>Kangaroo is the skin of the animal of that
name.</p>

<p>Buckskin is the skin of certain deer.</p>

<p>Sheepskin is the skin of the familiar domestic
sheep.</p>

<p>Chamois is the skin of the animal of that
name and by courtesy the specially treated
skins of certain domestic animals.</p>

<p>It is a simple matter to recognize a kid-skin
among the various kinds of upper
leather, because of its very light weight
and pliability.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>During the winter, leather, in drying,
is apt to become frozen, especially where no
well-equipped drying loft is provided. Such
leather becomes weak and limp if thawed
out too rapidly. In freezing, the water in
the hides which have been hung up to dry
is forced out and stretches apart the hide
fiber. The wetter the hides, therefore, the
more demoralized they will be by the frost.
The treatment of rushing the frozen leather
into a warm room is inadvisable; the best
method is to allow the hides to hang as they
were and to tightly close all openings to
the outside air. In case this is impossible,
it is best to place the leather in a heap, in a
room where the temperature will not fall
below the freezing point, and to cover it
with a cloth. In case the leather rolls up,
it should be moistened before the roll becomes
greater than is customary; it will
thus become firmer throughout. Some upper
leather and especially sheepskins for lining
purposes are aided by freezing, since the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
leather becomes white and plump and also
is of a bright color, though the durability
is somewhat lessened.</p>

<p>The popularity of white leather for shoes
is increasing wonderfully. There is good
reason for this. The modern white shoes
have a stylish and fashionable appearance
which has won the hearts of women of all
ages and conditions, and when they want
a thing, there is always alertness in supplying
it. The new love for white shoes is
interesting to trace. Years ago white
leather for shoes was made principally
from deerskins. But this leather, while
attractive when new, would stretch soon
after being worn, and take on a yellowish
tinge. Besides, the price of such shoes was
very high, and it is not surprising that they
became supplanted by the cheaper, but
attractive and useful, white canvas shoes,
which became quick sellers during the season.</p>

<p>It is greatly to the credit of our tanners
that they have been able to perfect and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
put on the market a white leather for shoes
which answers all requirements satisfactorily.
This leather is made from cowhides;
the white color will not fade nor turn
yellow, and best of all, the leather can be
easily cleaned and made to look good as
new. Another advantage is that such
leathers can be used in shoes that sell at
popular prices.</p>

<p>There are many common, commercial
grades of upper leather.</p>

<p>Willow calf is a fine, soft, chrome tannage
of calfskin. It is sold in three colors,
light tan, ox blood, and olive-brown. The
distinguishing features of this leather are
its durability and the fact that it always
keeps soft and pliable. It is adapted to the
highest quality of men’s and women’s shoes.</p>

<p>Box calf is a storm-calf leather of highest
quality. It is a waterproof, chrome tannage
in a medium tan color, with a dull
finish. This is the best leather obtainable
for rough, outdoor wear, walking shoes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
hunting boots, etc. It is also adapted to
men’s and women’s very fine footwear.
There is a growing demand for this kind
of shoe. In the uppers of the best storm
shoes you will always find box calf.</p>

<p>Royal kid is a black chrome calfskin,
dull finished with a smooth, natural grain
of fine texture, soft and pliable. It is used
for vamps and whole shoes of the highest
grades for men and women, and is a very
popular material for the fall and winter
shoe. The desirable qualities of fine calf
leather are making the demand for it
grow faster than the supply of raw material
increases.</p>

<p>Tan royal is a tan color, chrome calf
leather, smooth finish, fine grain, excellent
cutting qualities, uniform, of medium
rich tan shades. Tan calf leather is very
attractive and the tan shoe is now a staple
product.</p>

<p>Cadet kid is a bright black, smooth-finished,
chrome calfskin for men’s and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
women’s fine shoes. This tannage and
finish give a remarkable cutting value.
The stability of this stock is entirely unique
and makes the finished shoe stand up,
keeping its much desired shape through the
different tests of manufacturing. It is said
to be the best calfskin, by the best judges,
the shoe manufacturers.</p>

<p>Bronko patent is distinguished for its
fine, coltskin-effect grain. It has a rich
and lustrous black patent finish. The
results obtained from bronko patent in its
workings through the shoe factory and its
wearing qualities afterward have never been
equaled. Bronko is one of the finest results
of the development of chrome patent
leather.</p>

<p>Cadet kid side is a chrome side leather
that closely imitates the calfskin, called
cadet kid. It has a bright, lustrous finish,
and a remarkably fine grain. It is surprisingly
like fine calf leather in appearance.</p>

<p>Cadet calf sides are similar to cadet kid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sides with the exception of a boarded finish.
This is another black chrome, side leather
which comes very near to a calfskin.</p>

<p>Mat royal chrome side is a special finish,
closely resembling calf, used for the tops
of men’s and women’s medium fine shoes.</p>

<p>Black hawk patent is a well-tanned,
well-finished patent leather for medium-priced
women’s shoes and for tipping.</p>

<p>Colored box chrome side, boarded, is a
substitute for willow calf.</p>

<p>Black box chrome side, boarded, is a
substitute for box calf in medium fine shoes.</p>

<p>Kangaroo kid side is a back-tanned, dull,
smooth, black leather nearly like calf, used
in the tops of men’s shoes, and men’s and
women’s whole shoes.</p>

<p>Waterproof black is a high quality
leather of great durability for men’s and
boys’ heavy shoes. Waterproof brown is
similar to waterproof black, except in color,
and is a leather made for hard service.</p>

<p>Amhide black is a soft, dry, high-grade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
tannage for lightweight, comfortable, sporting,
work, and hard-wear shoes.</p>

<p>Amhide russet is like black amhide in
everything but color.</p>

<p>Hercules storm chrome is a leather distinguished
for its fine grain and good appearance
of medium heavy weight.</p>

<p>Boris is a heavy-weight, soft, waterproof
leather for men’s medium quality shoes. It
is finished in three colors and black.</p>

<p>Zulu is a medium-priced leather, which
makes a very fine wearing heavy shoe. It is
made in two colors and black.</p>

<p>Bison is a colored or black-finished
leather, of a high grade, very comfortable
and durable.</p>

<p>Ottawa is of two colors and black finished,
and is suitable for high quality, heavy,
rough shoes.</p>

<p>Sheboygan calf is a heavily stuffed, soft,
waterproof leather. It is of two colors and
black.</p>

<p>Dongola calf is a black leather used for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
durable, medium-priced, heavy, outdoor
shoes.</p>

<p>Belt knife splits are sold in several tannages
and finishes of the most improved
manufacture. These splits are sorted in
all weights. Uniform selection is maintained,
and the quality in every way is of
the highest order.</p>

<p>Oxford calf union splits is one of the
highest grades of grain-finished, union splits.
It has an extremely soft and fine appearance.</p>

<p>Cambridge calf union splits have a most
careful and high-grade finish, but somewhat
firmer than Oxford calf.</p>

<p>Flesh splits are sold in two tannages.
These are the highest-grade flesh splits
that it is possible to make, and they are a
long distance ahead of the ordinary flesh
splits, their improved finish making them
a modern and largely used substitute for
satin.</p>

<p>Ottawa black and russet splits include
a variety of printed splits, used for shoes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in combination with grain leather and for
whole shoes. They are selected in many
weights.</p>

<p>Flexible splits for Goodyear, gem, McKay
inner soles, is leather that offers the greatest
advantages to large and small buyers. It
is the product of six different tanneries,
assorted in all the usual weights. Great
care is taken in the manufacture of these
splits to adapt them perfectly to the shoe
manufacturer’s needs.</p>

<p>Flexible bends are used by manufacturers
of Goodyear welt shoes requiring a straight
Goodyear or gem inner sole. They find
these bends of great advantage on account
of the small amount of waste, the strength
and desirability of stock. They are made
in six tannages.</p>

<p>Chrome flexible splits for inner soles furnish
a very strong and durable leather for
inner soles, taps, and outer soles.</p>

<p>Ooze gusset splits, colored, give a very
low-priced leather suitable for gussets, bellows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
tongues for high-cut boots, also for
the quarter-linings of Oxfords.</p>

<p>Ooze vamp splits, black and colored, are
strong, durable, low-priced leathers suitable
for cheap work shoes where waterproof
qualities are not required.</p>

<p>Chrome-tanned embossed splits, colored,
are made in a great variety of patterns for
cheap shoes and other work where leather
is required. They are durable and low
priced.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Leather for Belting</span></h3>

<p>A native steer about four years old,
killed in the month of October, affords the
best example of a good hide for belting
manufacture, that is, for the transmission
of power from pulley to pulley. At this
age and at this season the steer is in prime
condition.</p>

<p>On account of the great and enormous
strain put upon belting, and the necessity
for its running true upon the pulley, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
should be of the highest grade possible,
combining great strength to prevent
stretching, and evenness of grain to insure
long wear; therefore only hides of selected
steers are serviceable, and these in turn
are rejected when they contain any blemishes
or cuts or other imperfections. After
a hide is accepted for belting purposes, it is
subjected to a generous trimming, the head,
neck, legs, and belly being cut away, leaving
only a small and compact section embracing
from two to two and a quarter feet on
each side of the backbone and extending
about six feet along the same from the
tail forward. This is the portion of the hide
where the fibers are closely and firmly
knit together, and where the vitality is
the greatest, due to the close proximity of
the network of nerves radiating from each
side of the spine to all parts of the hide.</p>

<p>The hides of the bull and cow of every
breed are inferior for belting purposes to
that of the steer. The hide of the bull is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
coarse and hard, with the neck very heavy
and full of wrinkles, causing a variation in
the thickness and run of the grain of the
leather. The hide of the cow is thin, does
not run uniform in thickness, being heavier
on the hips than at the shoulder, and is
lacking in the firmness necessary in good
belting. The sharp angles of the hip bones
of a cow also tend to form pockets in the
hide.</p>

<p>After the hide has been trimmed, it is
subject to the process of “currying.” All
membranes or particles of flesh adhering
to the hide are removed by a machine which
shaves the membrane, etc., off, with lightning
rapidity. The leather is then washed
and scoured by machine, which removes all
dirt still adhering to the hide. After the
leather is thoroughly cleaned and while in
a damp state, it is placed upon the table,
and greases, composed of pure animal oil,
are worked into the leather on both the
grain and the flesh side with brushes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
This is carried on in the cold state. It is
then put into a large revolving wheel
containing water heated to a high degree,
which causes the leather to swell and pores
to open. The leather is then taken out
and put into another wheel containing
heavy mineral oil and heated several degrees
greater than the water, and tumbled about
in the wheel until the heavy oil fills the
distended pores and fibers. After this, the
leather is allowed to dry.</p>

<p>The hides are allowed to remain for
several months in the tan liquor until the
green hide is changed into leather.</p>

<p>After the hide has been changed into
leather, it is stretched. To properly stretch
the leather for belting purposes, it must
first be cut so as to remove that part which
shows the markings of the backbone of
the steer.</p>

<p>Leather is stretched by placing it in
clamps, every part of the piece getting the
same pull. (The leather is put into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
clamps while damp, as damp leather will
give the greatest amount of stretching.)</p>

<p>When the stretching process is completed
and the leather has thoroughly dried in
stretching clamps, it is released. These
pieces of leather are quite dry, very firm,
and not very pliable. The leather is now
moistened in order that it shall be more
pliable as it passes through the finishing
processes. After the water has soaked into
the leather (called sammied), it becomes very
soft. It is then subjected to a roller under
heavy pressure to take all the unevenness
out of the hide. It is next thoroughly
dried, causing the fibers to shrink; then
again moistened and put through a polishing
machine, which acts on the same principle
as the rolling jack.</p>

<p>The sides and centers are now put through
a cutting machine, which reduces the leather
to strips of different sizes.</p>

<p>Belts are put together by cementing the
parts. Belt cement is a most powerful adhesive.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
It actually governs the strength of
the belt, as the belt is as strong as the weakest
part of the joint.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rawhide Products</span></h3>

<p>Rawhide is used for a great many purposes.
After the side of leather has been
trimmed of the portions that cannot be
used, it is sold to the lace maker. He
measures the same in a machine.</p>

<p>The trimmings from the side of the hide
may be used for a mallet head or other
tools made of leather. The most common
products of the strong section of rawhide
strings are shoe strings, belting laces, and
parts of harnesses. It is also made into
leather shoe strings that are used in the
logging camps.</p>

<p>When the hide is selected for the rawhide
purposes, it is first passed to a de-hairing
machine, where all the hair is removed.
It is then fleshed; that is, all loose membrane<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and any flesh that may have adhered
to the hide are removed from the flesh side.
The rawhide is then placed in a special
bath for the purpose of opening the pores,
before the oils and greases are added to it.
After this bath, it is dried thoroughly in a
hot box and then put into wheels which
mill the greases into the hide.</p>

<p>The hide, which is made hard by this
drying process, is put through breakers,
where it is thoroughly worked into soft
and pliable form.</p>

<p>The hide is next passed to the setting-out
machine, which finishes all forms of leather&mdash;by
condensing and strengthening the
fibers. Special oils are applied to both
the grain and flesh side of the hide. It is
finished by hand and cut into laces. This
hand finishing is usually done in order to
reject all parts that are not perfect.</p>

<p>Haired leather is tanned by acid&mdash;a
quicker method. The hide is split into
sides and tanned with the belly stock on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
them, which is used for car straps, cowbell
straps, trunk straps, and riding bridles.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">The By-products of a Leather Belting
Factory</span></h3>

<p>There are a great many by-products in
a leather belting factory, all of which are
used. The finest strips are used for whip
lashes, small pieces are used for the French
heel, and the extremely small pieces are
used in leather mats.</p>

<p>The by-product from the belting bull,
which is about fifty per cent, is used for shoe
leather and leather straps. There is considerable
leather taken from the belting
bull for certain harness work. The belly
is thick and porous though not tough, and
is used for halters, cow bridles, and other
parts of harness where the strain is not
great.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Round Belt Making</span></h3>

<p>Round belt is made from the best belting,
but while the strain on round belting is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
not severe, the leather must be soft and
pliable. It is selected from regular stock
of native steer hide.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Properties of Tanned Leather</span></h3>

<p>Leather that has been tanned is made
up of a great many little bundles of fibers.
The coarser and stronger fibers are on the
inside, and the very fine and smoothly laid
fibers are on the outside. These fibers are
so intertwined and so elastic that when the
leather bends these bundles play on one
another. On account of the smoothness
of the surface it may be polished, and
beautiful finishes and effects obtained on
the leather.</p>

<p>The elasticity of leather (which is due
to the elasticity of its fibers) allows it to
stretch to a great extent. The tendency
to return to its original position is very
strong at the beginning, but grows weaker
if the strain is continued at any one point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Of course, in stretching the leather, there is
always a corresponding drawing in another
part of the shoe, which gives it a worn and
baggy appearance.</p>

<p>When shoes are removed from the feet,
they are oftentimes damp, due to perspiration.
The stretched or strained fibers are
apt to shrink and return to their original
position. In order to avoid this, it is
necessary to place shoe-trees in them.</p>

<p>When the linings of shoes are exposed to
friction and excretion of perspiration from
the feet of some people, they deteriorate.
This is due to the fact that the acids of
perspiration (acetic, formic and butyric
acids) have become so concentrated that
they act on the fibers of the leather. These
acids exert a burning effect, causing the
fibers to lose their elasticity so that they
no longer play on one another, but become
fastened to each other. The result is that
they become hard, and any attempt to
bend the leather tears them apart; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
once the union of fibers is destroyed it
cannot be repaired.</p>

<p>In order to keep the fibers in such a
condition (soft and flexible), they should be
lubricated often (twice a week) with a liquid
followed by a wax paste, usually called
shoe dressing. When a brush or a piece of
cloth is rubbed over the surface of leather
containing the shoe lubricants (shoe polish),
it produces a smooth surface called a
“shine.”</p>

<p>Compounds which shine without friction
produced by brush or cloth should not be
used, as they are simply varnishes and
one coat on top of the other destroys the
leather.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Substitutes for Leather</span></h3>

<p>In olden times our fathers and mothers
used handmade shoes, and wore them till
they had passed their period of usefulness.
At that time the consumption did not equal
the production of leather. Knowledge of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
conditions in the great western countries
to-day will show that many of the big
cattle-raising sections, once famed for their
cattle, have been taken up by homesteaders
and are now producing grain instead of
cattle. But since the appearance of the
machine-made shoe, different styles of
shoes are placed on the market at different
seasons, to correspond to the change of
style of clothing, and shoes are often
discarded before they are worn out. We
have not been able thus far to utilize
cast-off leather as the shoddy mill uses
wool and silk, etc. The result is that
the consumption of leather is above the
production, therefore substitutes must be
used.</p>

<p>In shoe materials there is at present an
astonishing diversity and variety. Every
known leather is used from kid to cowhide,
and textile fabrics have developed rapidly,
especially in the making of women’s and
children’s shoes. The satins, velvets, serges,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and other fabrics that are used in the
manufacture of shoes must be firm and
well woven, and are usually supplied with
a backing of firm, canvas-like fabric, to
give strength.</p>

<p>As to wearing quality the old saying,
“There is nothing like leather,” still holds
good; but people do not buy shoes for their
wearing qualities alone in these days. Style
and intrinsic beauty are considered, and
have a cash value just as in any other
article of apparel.</p>

<p>Each fabric is made of two sets of threadlike
yarn woven at right angles to each
other. They are called the warp and filling
(weft). The warp is composed of yarn
running the longest way of the fabric, and
filling runs the short way of the fabric.
Since the warp is the body of the cloth, it
is its strongest part and all fabric in shoes
should be placed warpwise across the foot
of the wearer, so as to be able to resist the
great strain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Various attempts have been made for
legislation to prohibit the treating of leather
by chemicals or the use of substances to
increase its weight. Complaints have been
made by a number of shoe manufacturers
that the excessive use of glucose (a form
of sugar) in sole leather has resulted in
injuring the leather and fabrics composing
the uppers of shoes.</p>

<p>Representatives of large leather firms
claim that the methods of tanning sole
leather have radically changed during the
last few years, and that the small quantity
of glucose and epsom salts that is used
to-day in finishing sole leather is absolutely
necessary to its value, and is in no sense
an adulterant or weighting material. Shoe
manufacturers, on the other hand, claim
that in some cases larger amounts of glucose,
salt, etc., have been added to the soft
leather from the belly of the animal, in
order to give it the desired stiffness. On
account of the high price of leather, various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
attempts have been made to find a substitute
for it. Most of these substitutes consist
of strong cloth treated with some
drying oil like linseed, the oil having previously
been mixed with other solid substances.</p>

<p>A prize of five thousand francs has been
awarded to a Belgian inventor, Louis
Gevaert, for his unusually superior artificial
leather. The process consists in the more
or less intimate impregnation of stout cloth
with tannic albuminoid substances. Shoes
made of this are said to possess not only the
resistance and elasticity of natural leather,
but its durability of wear. Moreover, they
are much cheaper, costing, including manufacture,
only four francs (about eighty
cents) and being sold at about six francs
per pair.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_FOUR">CHAPTER FOUR<br />
<span class="smaller">THE ANATOMY OF THE FOOT</span></h2>

<p>Very few people, even among those
engaged in the shoe industry, know
much of the anatomy of the foot. Yet
it is evident that they ought to know something
about it in order to furnish the foot
with a proper covering.</p>

<p>The first thing that strikes a person on
looking at the human foot is its large proportion
of bone. On pressing its top surface
and that of its inner side, the amount of
flesh will be found to be very small, indeed.
The same is true of the inner and outer
ankle. The extreme back of the ankle has
scarcely any flesh covering. The most
fleshy portions of the foot are its outer side,
the base of the heel and the ball of the big
toe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>The reason for this disposition of flesh
is to protect or cover those parts of the foot
that support the body by coming in contact
with the ground. They act as pads and
lessen the concussion. The abundance of
flesh on the outer side of the foot is to protect
or act as a shield against danger. The
inside of the foot is not exposed as much as
the outside.</p>

<p>The foot is divided into three parts,
the toes, the waist and instep, and the heel
and ankle. The largest bone of the foot
is the heel bone (called calcaneum). It is
the bone that projects backward from the
principal joint and forms the main portion
of the heel. When a person is flat-footed,
this bone is thrust farther backward than
nature intended to have it. The connection
between it and the tarsal bones is lost.</p>

<p class="caption">The Different Parts of the Foot and Ankle. <i>See <a href="#Page_86">page 86</a>.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The top bone of the foot is the astragalus,
and it forms the main joint upon which
the process of walking depends. This bone
has a smooth, circular, upper surface that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
connects it with the main bone of the lower
leg. It is absolutely necessary that this
bone should be in perfect harmony (relation)
with the others in order to insure
comfort and health. If the arches of the
foot are forced out of position, up or down
or sidewise, this joint is not permitted to
do its work normally.</p>

<p>Rheumatism is a frequent evil of an
injured joint. Hence the necessity of absolutely
normal action, unhampered by ill-fitting
shoes.</p>

<p>The principal arch of the instep is called
the cuneiform or tarsal bone. Persons are
troubled with defective insteps to quite an
extent. Misshapen joints at this point
due to shoes that do not fit and consequently
disarrange and throw out of position
the delicate, natural structure, work great
havoc with the comfort of the foot. Nine
joints cluster at this point.</p>

<p>The bones of the toes are called the
metatarsal bones and phalanges. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
can be no doubt that nature intended
mankind to walk in his bare feet, and in
that event the phalanges of the foot would
occupy a much more important part than
is now the case as a result of modern civilization.
There are nineteen bones in the
foot, and the disturbance of one or more of
these will serve to upset the entire foot by
throwing out of relationship the general
unit of work devolving upon the whole
number of joints and bones. Each joint
has its accompaniment of muscles, and
each lack of alignment of bones and joints
provokes discord and lack of harmony in
the muscular action.</p>

<p>Muscles are attached to bones, and by
their contraction or extension the bones
are moved. Very few movements are
effected by means of a single muscle. The
muscles of the foot in nearly all cases are
in combination, and are so complex in their
action that the best surgeons find it difficult
to describe them satisfactorily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>The chief characteristics of the foot are
its spring and elasticity. While the foot
has wonderful powers of resistance and
adaptability, it is the shoemaker’s duty not
to strain the same, but to provide for each
action.</p>

<p>The most sensitive part or the one part
that is most susceptible of injury is the
big toe. This is due to the fact that the
tendency of the foot in walking is to travel
toward the toe of the boot, and in a word
to press into rather than shun danger. The
shoemaker provides for this, first, by allowing
sufficient length of sole to extend beyond
the termination of the toe, and second, by
the fit of the upper and the preparation of
the sole. In this way, if the toe of the
shoe strikes against a hard substance, the
big toe of the foot will remain untouched.</p>

<p>Seventy-five per cent of the people have
more or less trouble with their feet. Some
of these troubles are caused by the manufacturer
putting on the market shoes whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
lines look handsome and attractive to the
eye, but are lacking in any other good
features. Shoes that fit properly should
have plenty of room from the large toe
joint to the end of the toes, and also should
have plenty of tread, especially at this
point.</p>

<p>A mere glance at our bare foot will show
conclusively that pointed-toe boots are
false in the theory of design. The toes of a
foot when off duty touch each other gently.
When they are called on to assist us in
walking or in supporting our body, they
spread out&mdash;although not to any great
extent. This, then, being the action, no
sensible maker of boots and shoes would
attempt to restrain them. Box or puff-toe
shoes allow the greatest freedom.</p>

<p>The pointed-toe shoes, which join the
vamp to the upper immediately over the
big toe joint, exceedingly high heels, and
thick waist shoes are not for the best interests
of the foot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>The evils of ill-fitting shoes are corns,
bunions, and calluses.</p>

<p>Corns are mainly due to pressure and
friction. When the layers of skin become
hardened, they form a corn, which is merely
a growth of dead skin that has become
hard in the center. This hardened spot
acts like a foreign body to the inflamed parts.</p>

<p>A hard corn is formed more by friction
than pressure. It is produced by the
constant rubbing of a tight or small shoe
against the projecting parts of some prominent
bony part, as the last joints on the
third, fourth, and little toe. When this
action continues, it produces inflammation.
Rest&mdash;as relieving the feet of the friction&mdash;decreases
this inflammation, leaving a layer
of hardened flesh. Renewed action reproduces
the same effects, leaving behind a
second layer of hardened flesh. This continued
action and reaction brings on a
callus, rising above the surface of the
skin. This increases from its base. An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
ordinary hard corn may be removed by
scraping up the callous skin around its
border, and prying out carefully with a
knife. Soft corns are chiefly the result of
pressure or friction. These corns are soft
and spongy elevations on the parts of the
skin subjected to pressure. Soft corns
are mostly found on the inner side of the
smaller toes. Those on the surface of
joints by mechanical action will become
hard.</p>

<p>The blood corn is excessively painful.
It is the result of an ordinary corn forcibly
displacing the blood vessels surrounding it,
and causing them to rest upon its surface.</p>

<p>The bunion is an inflammatory swelling
generally to be found on the big toe joint.
The chief cause of bunions is known to be
the wearing of boots or shoes of insufficient
length. The foot, meeting with resistance
in front and behind, is robbed of its natural
actions, the result being that the big toe
is forced upward, and subjected to continuous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
friction and pressure. The wearing
of narrow-toe boots that prevent the outward
expansion of the toe is another cause.</p>

<p>The comparisons of quantities are often
called ratios. The ratios of the different
parts of the foot to the height are different
in the infant from that of the adult period.
Between these two periods the ratios are
constantly changing.</p>

<p>There are two series of shoe sizes on the
market; the smallest size of shoe for
infants (size No. 1) is, or was originally,
four inches long; each added full size
indicates an increase in length of one third
of an inch (sizes 1 to 5). Children’s sizes
run in two series, 5 to 8, and 8 to 11; then
they branch out into youths’ and misses’;
both running 11½, 12, 12½, 13, 13½ and back
again to 1, 1½, 2, etc., in a series of sizes that
run up into men’s and women’s. Boys’
shoes run from 2½ to 5½; men’s from 6 to
11 in regular runs. Larger sizes usually are
made upon special orders. Some few manufacturers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
go to 12. Women’s sizes run
from 2½ to 9. Some manufacturers do not
go above size 8. The rate of sizes is sometimes
varied from by manufacturers of
special lines of shoes. A man’s No. 8 shoe
would be nearly eleven inches long. These
measurements originated in England and
are not now absolute.</p>

<p>A system of French sizes is used which
consists of a cipher system of markings to
indicate the sizes as well as widths so that
the real size may not be known to the
customer.</p>

<p>All feet are not alike in structure and
shape. In infancy the foot is broad at
the toes, which press forward in the direction
of their length. The heel is small in
comparison to the width of the toes, and
also short in length, due to the undeveloped
bones. But during growth, the thickness
above the heel bones disappears, and the
heel itself becomes thicker and assumes the
beauty of perfection at maturity. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
development is due to the growth of bones
which must be well exercised and properly
cared for during this period. The various
parts of the feet and legs do not mature
at the same rate&mdash;those at the upper part
of the body increase at a greater rate than
the lower parts. Thighs develop first, next
the upper part of the legs, and lastly the feet.</p>

<p>The adult foot, when properly formed,
is straight from heel to toe on the inner side,
and is wider across the joints than one inch
or so farther back. The manner of walking
has a considerable bearing on the character
and development of the foot.</p>

<p>There are many sorts of feet, which are
due to a number of causes, such as habits,
climate, occupation, locality, etc. As a
general rule we may divide the feet into
four classes: Bony feet&mdash;those with very
little flesh upon them; hard feet&mdash;those
that have plenty of flesh, but which are
almost as hard as a stone; fat feet&mdash;plump,
with plenty of flesh, but having<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
little shape; spongy feet&mdash;those that seem
to have no bones in them, usually found
in the female sex.</p>

<p>The characteristics of a foot are common
with the body to which it is connected.
Some people have a strong, bony frame,
with strong, firm muscles, prominent bones
and muscles, and a flesh that is hard. The
feet of this type of person are usually long,
bony, and arched, with a well-developed big
toe joint. The heel measurements are large
in proportion. A soft foot is prevalent
among the Scotch. The feet of a person
who is delicately shaped, with a small
frame and thin, small, tapering muscles,
are usually thin and finely formed, giving
evidence of quickness. This kind of a
foot in a man has a tendency to develop a
flat foot.</p>

<p>A person with a form inclined to plumpness,
full of exercise and activity, and a good
circulation, has a well-developed foot.
The heel is round and fairly prominent,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
although there are no special bony prominences.
On the other hand a person
with a body of general roundness, but with
tissues and muscles flabby, and a languid
blood circulation, has feet that are short,
soft, and flabby.</p>

<p>We will allow that these four different
kinds of feet all measure a 4 size and D
in width. One would naturally think that
the same size shoe would fit them all, but
this is not so. This size shoe will only
fit one and that is the bony foot. The
hard feet require a C½ width; the fat feet
require a C width, and the sponge feet require
a B width.</p>

<p>The same last may, and often will possess
a slight variation in some manner or other.
The fitter of feet must know the stock, each
pair, and be on intimate terms with the
peculiarities of each last and the inside
lines of each pair of shoes before attempting
to try them upon the feet of the customer.</p>

<p>Different makes of footwear are apt to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
manufactured over a slightly varying system
of measurements. One line of shoes made
over a small measure may be longer or
shorter or narrower or wider than some
other line. The heel measurements require
careful study for each line introduced.
The peculiarities of each line must be tested
by tape and measure, and the foot fitter
must have a strong knowledge along these
lines.</p>

<p>We should measure the foot by the stick
if necessary, and make a note of the size
and width that will be likely to prove a fit.
The height of the arch must be considered,
and the shape of arch curve, the shape of
the instep, and the general contour of the
foot. A normal foot will show about a
half-inch arch. The average foot will carry
from an inch to an inch and a quarter heel,
without putting a strain on any of the
joints of the foot. Some feet vary from
this by a wide margin. A foot is a trifle
longer in walking than in repose. Allowance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
should be made, in using the measuring
stick, over what the foot actually draws
on the stick. In men’s shoes the allowance,
should be from two to two and one half
sizes.</p>

<p>When a one-legged man buys a shoe, the
dealer sends to the factory a shoe to match
the one left remaining. In these days of
the use of machinery in every process of
their manufacture, shoes are made with the
utmost exactness and precision, and it is
easily possible to mate that remaining shoe
with the greatest nicety in size, style, material,
and finish.</p>

<p>Few people have feet exactly alike;
commonly the left foot is larger than the
right, so that one shoe may fit a little
more snugly than the other. Commonly,
however, people buy shoes in regularly
matched pairs, the difference in their feet,
if it is noticeable to them at all, not being
enough to make any other course desirable.</p>

<p>But there are people who buy shoes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
different sizes or widths, in which case the
dealer breaks two pairs for them, giving
them, to fit their feet, one shoe from each.
In such cases the dealer matches up the
two remaining shoes, one from each of two
pairs just as he would where he had broken
one pair to sell one shoe to a one-legged man.</p>

<p>But a man does not have to be one-legged
nor to have feet of uneven sizes or
shapes to make him ask the dealer to break
a pair of shoes for him. A man with two
perfectly good feet came into the store
where he was accustomed to buy and wanted
one shoe. While traveling in a sleeping
car, his shoes had been mixed up with
others and he had received back one of his
own and one of some other man’s; a fact
which he had not discovered until he was
too far away from train and station to set
things right. So he came in to buy one
shoe to match his own.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_FIVE">CHAPTER FIVE<br />
<span class="smaller">HOW SHOE STYLES ARE MADE</span></h2>

<p>If you examine the shoes worn by
people in a large city, you will notice
different styles. Shoe styles that were
called grotesque a few seasons ago are
comparatively usual to-day, for the new
designs in women’s footwear, which manufacturers
are now making, are the most
varied that ever have been put on the
market. Pink and green and blue are
among the new colors in materials for footwear.</p>

<p>Some of the styles for the coming seasons
are more lavish than have hitherto been
seen in the women’s shoe trade of America.
Coronation purple velvet boots look like
an extravagant color for footwear, but
they are now selling. Samples of pink,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
green, and blue shoes, both boots and pumps,
are being made up, and they will soon be
offered to buyers.</p>

<p>The style of the shoe is dominated by
fashion. All styles are related, that is,
every part of our dress is influenced by the
prevailing fashion, ideas of color, fabric,
or garment outline. To illustrate: when
short skirts are stylish, women wear mannish
shoes to harmonize with them; on the
other hand, with long skirts they must
have a shoe that is neat and small, hence,
the short vamp. When women wear white
in the summer, cool canvas shoes spring
into favor; when gray and blue dress
materials are to be used, a variety of tan
shoes are worn to harmonize, etc.</p>

<p>After the style has been decided upon,
it is necessary to work out an exact reproduction.
An expert model maker, called a
last maker, produces a last, a wooden model
of the shoe. In order to do this, it is necessary
to lay out certain plans or specifications<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
for the details of the manufacturer
of the shoe.</p>

<p>There are certain parts of all feet that
have fixed measurements. To illustrate:
the length of the shank, that part of the
sole of the foot between the heel and ball,
in every person’s foot is always the same.
The part of the foot back of the ball or
large toe joint conforms to certain fixed
measurements. These definite measurements
form a basis by which the last
maker originates new styles by shortening,
lengthening, widening, or narrowing the
space in front of the toes, but always
retaining the true and fixed measurements
of the back part of the last.</p>

<p>When the last maker desires to produce a
new style, he takes an old last and tacking
pieces of leather on some parts of it (front
of the toes), he builds it up and cuts off
other parts. This patched-up last is taken
to a special machine (lathe), where a number
of duplicates are turned from a block of wood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>The “pattern maker” is the man in the
factory who makes patterns, consisting of
heavy pieces of cardboard bound with brass,
in the shapes of the various pieces of leather
required to make up the upper part of the
shoe.</p>

<p>The pattern maker has found by experience
that the top part of the shoe also
conforms to certain fixed measurements,
and by working in sympathy with the
last maker he need only to change the
front part of the vamp to bring out the
latter’s ideas. With these measurements
as a foundation, he puts forth from time to
time different style uppers, as buttons, lace,
blucher, fixings, scrolls, straps, ties, pumps,
etc. This is the way new style tops originate.</p>

<p>After the manufacturer has approved of
sample patterns, the pattern maker receives
an order for a certain quantity of patterns
to be made over a certain last which is
submitted to him. Working on the fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
top measurements and the last submitted as
a basis, the pattern maker draws plans for
a model pattern. The standard size of a
model pattern is size 7 in men’s shoes and
size 4 in women’s. He is also given an
order for a certain number of widths; for
instance, B, C, D, and E, and he draws
out on paper a complete set for each width
in the size 7. These four sets of model
patterns are reproduced and cut out in sheet
iron by hand. But from these sheets any
number of iron models, and any size regular
cardboard pattern can be reproduced by a
machine.</p>

<p>Wood to be made into lasts comes to the
shoe manufacturers in a rough, unchiseled
form. The lasts are made of maple wood;
hollow forms used by traveling salesmen and
window trimmers are made of bass wood.</p>

<p>The making of the model of the last is
the most exacting operation in the factory.
It is produced by a machine most important.
The principle of this machine has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
brought about by the pantograph; that is,
it will turn from a rough block of wood an
exact copy of the model last; or it will
enlarge or reduce a duplicate of any other
size or width, so, from a single model last,
such as the manufacturer has decided on,
any number of lasts can be made, and of
any size or width. The machine itself
consists of two lathes. On one is placed
the model and on the other the block of
wood. The model is held against a wheel
by a spring. By adjusting this wheel,
any desired width last can be obtained,
and by adjusting a bar in front of the
machine any length last can be produced
from the block of wood.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus9" style="width: 420px;">

<img src="images/illus9c.jpg" width="420" height="160" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A Finished Last.</p>
</div>

<p>The lathe, when in motion, revolves
both the last and the model, the model
being pressed against the wheel, which is
really a guide for the revolving knife that
digs into the block of wood, and regulates
the depth that the knife is allowed to cut.
In this manner the model is reproduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
from the block which is also regulated as to
size and width by the wheel and by the bar.
This machine is so accurate that a tack
driven into the model to locate the center
of the last is reproduced by a sort of a
wooden pimple in the block of wood when
finished. The model sole pattern is now
tried on the half-finished last to insure
accuracy.</p>

<p>Notice in the figures of lasts that the
turning lathe has left stubs of wood on the
toes and heels. These must be finished to
a “templet.” The templet is a measure
or guide used to indicate the shape any
piece of work is to assume when finished.
From the heel and toe of the model, a piece
of iron is shaped on an exact arc of that
model, and is used on the heeler machine
as a guide to form an exact copy of the
heels and toes of the model. This machine
works very rapidly, and by the aid of an
irregular shaped, revolving knife it quickly
transforms the toes and heels to the desired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
shape. The bottoms are again tried out
on a sole pattern and the last number, the
size and the width are stamped on.</p>

<p>We now have the last as a solid piece
of maple wood and turned to the desired
shape, size and width. Were it possible
to insert and extract the last in this form
from the half-finished shoe, no other steps
would be necessary in last manufacture,
but inasmuch as the leather is stretched
very tightly over this last a little later, it
necessitates the introduction of some method
that will facilitate a quick removal of the
last from the shoe. This is accomplished
by cutting it in two parts and making a
hinged heel. The fact that the slightest
measurement changes the size of the shoe,
necessitates great care in the introduction
of the hinge as a part of the last, and in
order to insure accuracy and uniformity
in all the lasts, they are marked with
templets and gigs. The hinge must be
placed inside of the last.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>The finished last is so constructed that
it can be readily inserted or withdrawn
from the shoe, and the strong hinge provides
the last, when inserted, with the same rigid
qualities as though it were one piece.
The center of the last is indicated, as before
stated, by a reproduction in the side of the
last of the tack that was placed in the
model. This is the mark that locates the
position of all the holes, and it is done by a
“gig” in the following manner:&mdash;</p>

<p>A gig is a piece of steel having cylinders
that guide the bit of the boring machine
in an exact perpendicular line. This gig,
being placed on the last in the position
marked by the turning machine, forms the
accurate location of the bolt holes that
hold the hinge.</p>

<p>After the hinge is placed in the last, it
goes to the ironers to have the bottom put
on it, if it is a McKay last, and a heel
plate if it is a welt. The bottom is again
tried and the plate filled up to the same.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
The last is then ready to go to the scouring
room. In this room the last goes through
three operations, first of which is ruffing.
This consists of scouring with a coarse
grade of quartz. This operation must be
carried on so that the sole lines and insteps
are not brought into contact with the
quartz.</p>

<p>The second operation, medium grinding,
is done with a fine grade of quartz, and in
this operation, also, the worker keeps away
from the toe. The third operation is done
with a much finer-grade quartz, the operator
going over the entire last. The last is now
ready for polishing, and after that, for a
heavy coat of shellac. It is polished and
waxed on a leather wheel. Then it goes
into the shipping room ready for shipment
to the manufacturer.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_SIX">CHAPTER SIX<br />
<span class="smaller">DEPARTMENTS OF A SHOE FACTORY&mdash;GOODYEAR
WELT SHOES</span></h2>

<p>The principal methods of manufacturing
shoes are the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>Goodyear welt; McKay; turned; standard
screw; pegged; nailed.</p>

<p>The simplest and the clearest way of
showing how the various kinds of shoes are
made is to explain the manufacture of a
Goodyear welt and afterwards bring out
the points in which this method of shoemaking
differs from the others.</p>

<p>Shoes are manufactured in up-to-date
factories, employing hundreds of operatives.
The modern shoe factory of to-day is divided
into six general departments: the sole
leather department, upper leather department,
stitching department, making department,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
finishing department, and the treeing,
packing, and shipping departments.</p>

<p>In some sections of the country, several
of these departments are often designated
by other names. The stitching department
is often called the fitting department; the
making department, the bottoming department;
and the sole leather department,
the stock-fitting department. The departments
are popularly termed rooms for
brevity.</p>

<p>A shoe factory is designed so as to have
a width of about fifty feet for each room,
while the length is according to the number
of shoes to be produced. A width of about
fifty feet gives plenty of daylight and ample
room in the center of each department,
which is very essential in shoemaking.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus10" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/illus10.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A Modern Shoe Factory.</p>
</div>

<p>Shoe factories are usually about two
hundred feet long, while many are nearly
four hundred feet. A few exceed four hundred
feet, running as long as eight hundred
feet. Some are built in the shape of hollow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
squares, while others have wings added,
which give almost as much floor space as
the original building.</p>

<p>The average factory has usually four
floors. The first floor, or basement, is
occupied by the sole leather department.
The next floor above includes the treeing,
finishing, packing, and shipping departments,
and also the office. The third floor is
devoted entirely to the making or bottoming
department. The top floor is divided
so that the cutting and stitching departments
have each half a floor.</p>

<p>There are several exceedingly large factories
in this country that find it advantageous
to divide the factory into more
departments, as, for example, the cutting
room is divided so that the linings and
trimmings are cut in a separate department.
The skiving may also be done in a separate
room. The making room will be divided
so that the lasting is set off as a separate
department on account of the many workmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
and machines employed. In the same
way there will be a division of work so that
the packing and shipping will be set apart
from the treeing. Then, again, in the sole
leather room, the making of heels as well
as the fitting of the bottom stock may
become independent departments.</p>

<p>The system of making women’s shoes is
practically the same as that of men’s
except that in a great many factories the
method of preparing the bottom stock is
somewhat different. Most manufacturers
of women’s shoes do not cut sole leather,
but buy outsoles, insoles, counters, and
heels, all cut or prepared. These soles are
in blocked form and large enough so that
they can be cut or rounded by the manufacturers
to fit their lasts. The counters,
when bought, are all ready to put in the
uppers, while the heels are ready to put on
the shoes. Whenever a manufacturer of
women’s shoes cuts his sole leather, he has the
same system as that in the men’s factories.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>In women’s factories where sole leather
is not cut, they do not have a complete
sole leather department. Instead, they
have what is called a stock-fitting department.
There are independent cut sole
houses, etc., in the trade, which supply
the soles to manufacturers. The same
system of buying supplies also applies to
many other parts of the shoe, as in the
top lift, half sole, welt, rand, etc. In the
upper leather department, manufacturers
of both men’s and women’s shoes often
buy trimmings and other parts of the upper
all prepared.</p>

<p>A large proportion of the men’s shoe
manufacturers are now buying heels all built,
while fully nine tenths buy counters all
molded. The soles and other parts that are
needed for a shoe are put up in different
qualities and grades, and a manufacturer can
buy any grade of sole he wants, so that it is
considered an advantage to buy some parts,
instead of cutting them. In a side of sole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
leather there are twenty-five or more different
qualities and grades of soles, and
very few manufacturers, especially in the
women’s trade, can use all of these. The
greater variety of shoes a manufacturer
turns out, the more advantageous it is
for him to cut his own sole leather, and
prepare all parts in his own factory.</p>

<p>In this country the number of factories
in the shoe trade appears to be growing less
and the average factory larger each year.
It is estimated that there are at present
something like fifteen hundred factories in
all. These range from the smallest product
up to the largest. The average factory may
be said to produce about twelve hundred
pairs of shoes per day. Many turn out
five thousand pairs daily, while a few
manufacturers turn out ten thousand or
more pairs. Several manufacturers and
firms have half a dozen or more factories
and have a total output of between twenty
thousand and thirty thousand pairs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
shoes a day. There is no such thing as a
trust or monopoly of any kind in this trade,
and there never has been up to the present
time.</p>

<p>In all factories and all classes of work,
the “case” has always been of such a
number of pairs that it can be divided by
twelve in every instance. A case can be
twelve, twenty-four, thirty-six, forty-eight,
sixty, or seventy-two pairs, and in children’s
work it is often sixty and seventy-two pairs.
All cases of these numbers are regular
cases, whereas any other number would be
out of the ordinary. Of course, a case of
shoes may contain any number of pairs,
but the numbers given above have always
been used in regular work.</p>

<p>Cases of shoes may differ, but every
pair of shoes in any one case must be made
exactly alike. All shoes are made in cases,
except in the matter of custom work or
single-pair orders or samples. In making
men’s heavy shoes, or working shoes, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
regular case was formerly sixty pairs or
thirty-six pairs, but the tendency has been
of late to have a standard case of twenty-four
pairs. In the men’s fine trade the
regular case is twenty-four pairs, while in
the women’s it is thirty-six pairs. Long
boots for men have always been made in
twelve-pair cases.</p>

<p>Goods are sold by the samples, sent out
with the traveling salesman. As fast as he
receives an order, he sends it to the main
office. Here the orders are subdivided and
sent to the factories making the goods.
For example, an order for seventy-five
dozen men’s shoes of a certain style received
by the main office from the traveling salesman
would be sent to the factory in the
form of a typewritten order, covering the
general description and sizes written out
in the proper form, for each case is made
according to the specifications on the tags
that are made out in the office. These
tags specify the sole, heel, upper, kind and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
quality, how stitched, the last to be used,
how bottomed finished, treed, and packed.
Everything is marked plainly on the tags
so that a buyer can have any shoe made
just as he wants it.</p>

<p>This order would be sent from the factory
office to the cutting room, where a clerk
would make out twenty-five long tickets.</p>

<p>Twenty-five are made because the shoes
go through the factory in lots of twenty-four
pairs, each lot being called a job and
when finished making a case of shoes. The
long ticket is made in duplicate form, and is
perforated so it may be tied to a lot of shoes.
Both parts of the tickets are made out
to contain the various operations with the
specifications as to detail. The lower part
is sent to the stock or sole leather room,
while the top part remains with the uppers
which are cut in the cutting room. While
each part of the ticket is sent by a different
route through the factory, they finally
meet in the form of finished shoes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>In addition to the long ticket already
described, two other tickets are made out,
the top ticket and the trimming ticket.
The top ticket is sent to the leather bins
of the factory, where the sorter knows by
experience exactly the amount of leather
required to cut the order, being careful to
see that it is all of uniform quality and
free from blemishes. He rolls the leather
in a bundle, attaches the ticket and sends
it to the cutter.</p>

<p>In the cutting room there are three classes
of cutters; cutter of trimmings, who cuts
lace stays, top facings, back stays, tongues,
etc.; outside cutter, who cuts quarters,
vamps, tops, tips, etc.; and the lining
cutter, who cuts cloth linings.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus11" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/illus11.jpg" width="420" height="400" alt="" />
<p class="caption">A Nine and One-Half Foot Skin divided to best advantage before
Cutting.</p>
</div>

<p>Skins of leather are received in the shoe
factory in different shapes. Some are perfect,
others have blemishes or imperfect
spots. The skins that are to be used for
upper stock are carefully graded by two or
three men, as to quality of leather and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
weight. This is necessary in order to be
sure that a lot of shoes made for a certain
dealer will be uniform. On account of the
leather coming in different shapes, some
skins perfect, others having imperfect spots,
the cutter must place his patterns in such
a way that certain parts of the shoe will use
up all the perfect parts, and others, less
important, will be composed of the weaker
parts of the skin. This explains why you
sometimes find the inside top part of a shoe
made of flanky leather, while the vamp is
made of a better grade.</p>

<p>There is a pattern for each and every
size shoe, and each piece of leather is cut
out separately on a block of wood. Nothing
is wasted. In order to make each cutter
as efficient as possible, the cutters are divided,
so as to have a different cutter for
each grade of leather. In this way they
become better judges of leather.</p>

<p>The lining cutters use patterns and
knives on drilling. The facing is cut out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
with a knife and pattern. The side stays
and the tongue are cut out by dies.</p>

<p>After the leather has been cut into the
desired shape, uppers, vamps, toe pieces,
back stays, lace stays, etc., cutting at
times ten pieces, and for some styles of
shoes as many as fourteen pieces, the cutters
take care to keep the parts for the same
shoe together, matching and marking them
so that eventually all will meet again in
the shoe.</p>

<p>Machines are used now on almost every operation,
and annually several new machines
make their appearance. The cutting of
uppers up to four or five years ago was
performed by an operator cutting the
leather by running the knife along the
side of the pattern. Now they are using
a cutting machine and dies to cut uppers in
nearly all factories. This cutting machine
is called the “clicking machine,” and it
is considered quite a labor saver in a
department where it was the universal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
opinion that machines never could be
used.</p>

<p>It is impossible to give a list of all the
operations performed and have it complete.
But a good general idea of the system can
be given and the name and meaning of the
main operations in the several departments.
It should be kept in mind that the methods
in rooms differ, and that hardly any two
factories put a shoe through in exactly the
same manner. The general system and
plan is the same everywhere and the
machines are the same in all factories, but
the details and minor operations are so
numerous that there is plenty of scope for
them to vary.</p>

<p>The function of the clicking machine is
to cut the upper leather into the desired
shapes required. It consists of an iron
frame, with a cutting board on the top of
it. Above this is a large beam which can
be swung to the right or left of any portion
of the board. The skin to be cut,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
which may be of any kind, is placed on
the board and a die of the design or
shape of the leather desired is placed on it.
The handle of the swinging beam is
taken by the operator and moved over the
die; then by pressure of the handle the
beam is brought downward, pressing the
die through the leather. As soon as this
is done, the beam automatically returns to
its full height.</p>

<p>These dies are made in different designs
and sizes to meet the different sizes and
designs in the upper of the shoe. One
die for each design and size. They mark
the vamps for the location of the toe cap
and blucher foxings as well as the size by
means of nicks in the edge of the piece cut.
The dies are about three-quarters of an
inch in height and so light that they do
not mar the most delicate leather.</p>

</div>

<p>After the outside cutter has cut the skin
into pieces to make up the shoe, these are
tied up in separate bundles, that is, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
twenty-four of tips in one bundle, twenty-four
pairs of vamps in another. These are
turned over to girls who stencil the sizes
on the edge and match them, that is, see
that each upper is exactly like the mate.</p>

<p>After the different parts have been cut
by the operator of the clicking machine or
by hand, the edges of the upper leather,
which shows in the finished shoe, must be
thinned down (skived) by a “skiving
machine” to a beveled edge. This is
done in order that the edges of the leather
that are to show in the completed shoe may
be folded to give a more finished appearance.
The machines are operated by girls;
each one an expert on one particular piece.</p>

<p>The order number and size of shoe are
stamped on the top lining of each shoe.
After all linings have been prepared, according
to the data given on the instruction
card attached to parts of the shoe, the
parts are sent to the stitching department,
where the stitchers on a multitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
machines stitch all the different parts
together very rapidly and accurately.</p>

<p>The toe caps are then given a series of
ornamental perforations along the edge.
This is done by either “power tip press,”
or a “perforating machine.” The first
consists of a series of dies placed in a machine
by which the leather is perforated according
to the designs desired. Each series
of dies represents a different design.</p>

<p>The perforating machine resembles a
sewing machine, but instead of a series of
dies, the one in this machine is made of
single or combination dies which make one
or more holes on each downward movement.
The machine feeds automatically and does
the work very accurately. The cutting
tool is kept from becoming dull by pressing
against a band of paper. Ornamentation
on other parts of the shoes, such as the edges
of vamps, etc., is made by this machine.</p>

<p>Before going to the stitching room, every
bundle is examined by sorters. The sorters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
are divided and subdivided; that is, one
man always sorts tips, another vamps, etc.
They examine each piece for imperfection,
and if any is found, the piece is thrown out
and a new one put in. The last operation
is the assembling of pieces. Here each
job of twenty-four pairs is brought together
and securely tied and numbered.</p>

<p>This stitching department is one in which
female labor is generally employed, although
in late years more men are being used to
operate machines, especially on vamping or
other heavy parts. In some parts of the
country it is called the fitting room. The
work of the department consists of stitching
the different parts of the upper together,
so that it is ready to put on the last. The
terms used mean in most cases stitching
the part named to the rest of the upper.
There are very many operations in the
department, several of which are named
below, together with their meaning.</p>

<p>The bundles of pieces which have come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
from the cutting room are placed on the
table, where they are subdivided into three
parts, the linings, the tops, the vamps and
the tips.</p>

<p>The linings for the tops of the shoes are
pasted together (with the back strap and top
bands), care being taken to join them at the
marks made for that purpose. After being
dried, they go into the hands of the machine
operators, where they are joined together
by a stitching machine, and the edges, etc.,
trimmed. The sewing machines used are
very similar to an ordinary home sewing
machine, with the exception that they are
much larger and stronger.</p>

<p class="caption">Stock Fitting Room.</p>
<p class="caption">Where all bottom stock is prepared after being cut. <i>See <a href="#Page_120">page 120</a>.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The lining is finished. The next step is
to join the lining to the piece of leather
making up the outside of the same shape,
called the top. The top receives the eyelets
by a machine placed in proper position.
The top and lining can be put together by
sewing them face to face. The top is
inspected and all threads clipped off.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>After the shoe uppers have been properly
stitched together, the eyelets are placed
on by a “duplex eyeletting machine,”
which eyelets both sides of the shoe at one
time. The top of the eyelets are solid
black knobs, so as not to wear brassy, while
the bottom (which clinches inside the shoe)
called the barrel, is of nickel. This finishes
the shoe upper.</p>

<p>The vamp, tongues, and tip are then put
together. The edges of the vamps, quarters,
tips, etc., are covered with a cement
made of rubber and naphtha, which is
kept in small bowls on the benches in front
of employees. Several grades of cements
are used. The cemented parts are allowed
to dry, and the edges are then turned over
by “pressing machines,” which gives a
finished appearance. The shoe is put together
by stitching the vamp to the quarters.
This work is done by both men and
women, and is work which demands much
care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>In stitching men’s uppers, the system
varies in various factories as much as it
does on women’s. Here are some of the
operations, which will give an idea how
men’s uppers go through.</p>

<p>Extension or toe piece sewed to vamp.</p>

<p>Leather box stitched on.</p>

<p>Tip stitched to vamp.</p>

<p>Vamp seamed up back.</p>

<p>Lining and outside pasted together.</p>

<p>Hooking.</p>

<p>Vamping.</p>

<p>The upper is complete when it leaves the
stitching room and is all ready to be put
on the last. While the upper is being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
prepared, the soles, insoles, counters, and
heels are made in other departments.</p>

<p>When the foreman of this department
has received the tags with the data necessary
for the preparation of outsoles, insoles,
counters, toe boxes, and heels, they
are sent to the stock room, where these
parts are kept.</p>

<p>The soles are roughly cut out by means
of dies, pressing down through the leather,
in “dieing out machines.” Before the soles
are cut, the leather is dipped in water and
sufficiently dampened. After they are cut
out, they are made to conform to the exact
shape by rounding them in a machine
called the “rounding machine.” The
roughly died out piece of leather is held
between clamps, one of which is the exact
pattern of the sole. The machine works a
little knife that darts around this pattern,
cutting the sole exactly to conform. The
outsole is now passed to a heavy rolling
machine, where it is pressed by tons of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
pressure between heavy rolls. This takes
the place of the hammering which the old-time
shoemaker gave his leather to bring
the fibers very closely together, so as to
increase its wear.</p>

<p>Counters and toe boxes (stiffening which
is placed between the heel and toe cap and
the vamp of shoe) are prepared in the same
room with the heels. After they are made,
they are sent to the making or bottoming
room, where the shoe upper is awaiting
them. As the counter is an important
feature in the life of a shoe, much depends
upon the quality of leather that goes into it.</p>

<p>The sole is next fed to a “splitting
machine,” which reduces it to an absolutely
even thickness. The insole is made of
lighter leather than the outsole, but has the
same thickness and is cut out in the same
way one at a time. The sizes are stamped
on them and they are sorted.</p>

</div>

<p>If you examine a Goodyear welt shoe,
you will notice no stitches in sight, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
seam being fastened to an under portion of
the insole. The durability of the shoe
relies, to a great extent, on the quality and
strength of the insole.</p>

<p>The smooth-appearing insole of a welt
shoe must be either pasted in or fastened
underneath in some manner. This fastening
is accomplished by passing the insole
through a very small machine called a
Goodyear channeler, which makes two incisions
at one operation. It cuts a little
slit along the edge of the insole, extending
about one-half inch toward its center.</p>

<p>The upper part of insole made by the
slit on the edge is turned up on a lip
turning machine so that it extends out at
right angles from the insole. In other
words, the channel is opened up and laid
back, forming a ridge around the outer edge
of the sole. This forms a lip or shoulder,
against which the welt is sewed. In this
way the thread used in sewing cannot be
seen in the finished shoe. The cut made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
on the surface serves as guide for the
operator of the welt sewing machine when
the shoe reaches him.</p>

<p>The inner and outer soles as well as the
uppers are now brought into the lasting or
gang room. The first part of lasting is
called “assembling,” which means that
many parts are brought together, such as
upper, counter, insole, box toe, and last.
The counter is placed in the upper, between
lining and vamp, while the box toe is shellacked
and put in the toe of the upper
(provided it has not been stitched in the
stitching room). The operator first tacks
the inner sole on to a wooden last.</p>

<p>There are very many different styles of
lasts, and in cutting uppers a different
pattern must be used for each style. Then
the upper is placed in position on the last,
and it is ready to be pulled and stretched
to the wood and take its required shape.
This is accomplished by placing the shoes
on the “pulling over machine,” where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
the shoe uppers are correctly placed on the
last by the pincers of a machine holding
the leather at different points securely
against the wood of the last. By the
movements of levers the shoe uppers are
adjusted correctly. Then the pincers draw
the leather securely around the last and at
the same time two tacks on each side and
at the toe are driven in part way, to hold
the uppers securely.</p>

<p>It is now placed on the “hand method
lasting machine,” where the leather is drawn
tightly around the last. Before this operation,
it is dipped in water to preserve its
shape when formed and that it may be
more easily formed by the machine. At
each pull of the pincers a small tack,
driven automatically part way in, holds the
edge of the upper exactly in place, so that
every part of the upper has been stretched
in all directions equally. A special machine
by means of a series of “wipers” is used to
last the toe and heel. After the leather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
has been brought smoothly around the toe,
it is held there by a little tape fastened on
each side of the toe, which is held securely
in place by the surplus leather, crimpled
in at this point. The surplus leather
crimpled in at the heel is forced smoothly
down against the insole and held there by
tacks driven by an ingenious hand tool. In
all these lasting operations the tacks are only
driven in part way, so they may afterwards
be withdrawn and leave the inside perfectly
smooth, except at the heel of the shoe,
where they are driven into the iron heel
of the last and clinched.</p>

<p class="caption">Edge Trimming. <i>See <a href="#Page_130">page 130</a>.</i></p>
</div>

<p>After these operations, the surplus
leather at the toe and sides of the shoe is
removed by the “upper trimming machine,”
which cuts it away by means of a little
knife and leaves it very smooth and even.
A small hammer operating in connection
with the knife pounds the leather on the
same parts. A pounding machine hammers
the leather and counter around the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
heel so that the stiff position conforms exactly
to the last.</p>

<p>After the “lasted” shoe has been trimmed
and pounded down to the shape of the last,
it is turned over to the tack setter, who
pulls out all the tacks except a few, called
draft tacks. The insole is then wet to
make it pliable, and is turned over to a
very experienced operator, called the “inseamer,”
who is to sew the welt on.</p>

<p>The shoe is now ready to receive a narrow
strip of prepared leather, that is sewed
after it is wet to make it pliable, along the
edge of the shoe, beginning where the heel is
placed and ending at the same spot on the
opposite edge. This is called the welt, and
is sewed from the inside lip of the insole,
so that the curved needle passes through
the lip, the upper, and the welt, uniting
all three securely and allowing the welt to
protrude beyond the edge of the shoe.
The thread is very stout linen, and is
passed through a pan of hot wax before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
being looped into chain stitch that holds
the shoe together.</p>

<p>The nature of the stitch is a chain&mdash;two
rows of threads on the outside that
loop with the single thread in the inside
lip of the insole. When the welt is finally
sewed on, and the shoe put down on the
bench, it looks like an ordinary shoe resting
on a wide flange of leather. This flange is
the welt, and to it the heavy outer sole is
to be sewed fast. Should a single stitch
break in this operation, it is passed to a
cobbler, who repairs it by hand.</p>

<p>Before the outer sole is put on, the edges
of the uppers must be trimmed along the
seam that holds the welt. A slip of steel
called steel shank is laid along the insole
where the hollow of the foot is, and a piece
of leather board laid over this to give the
necessary stiffness and prevent the shoe
from doubling up. As the welt has left a
hollow space along the ball of the foot, it is
necessary to fill this up, either with a piece<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of leather, tanned felt, or other filler. Felt
is not waterproof, and leather squeaks,
hence a mixture of ground cork and rubber
cement is used. This is heated and spread
on the sole, and run over a hot roller until
the bottom of the shoe is perfectly smooth
and even. The shoes are placed on a rack
and are ready for the outsole.</p>

<p>Sole fastening is performed by a number
of operations, in which a score or more
of separate machines are used. The sole
layers smear a rubber cement over this
welt with a “cementing machine,” after the
outsole has been soaked in water to make it
pliable, and then place it on the shoe and
tack a single nail in the heel. The “sole
laying machine,” through great pressure,
cements the sole on and fits it to every
curve of the last. Then the sole is trimmed
by a “rough rounding machine,” which
trims the soles to the shape of the last.
This machine also channels the outer sole
at the same time, which is necessary for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the next operation. The “channel opening
machine” now turns up the lips of the
channel and the sole is ready to be stitched
to the welt.</p>

<p>The outsole is now sewed by a waxed
thread to the welt, by an “outsole lock stitch
machine,” which is similar to a welt sewing
machine. The stitch is finer and extends
from the slit (channel) to the upper side
of the welt, where it shows after the shoe
has been finished.</p>

<p>It unites the sole and welt with a tightly
drawn lock stitch of remarkable strength.
It sews through an inch of leather as easily
as a woman would sew through a piece of
cloth. The stitches are made through the
welt and outer sole, the seam running in
the channel of the outsole.</p>

<p class="caption">Heeling. <i>See <a href="#Page_136">page 136</a>.</i></p>
</div>

<p>The inside of the slit in which this stitch
has just been made is now coated with
cement by means of a brush. The channel
lip is forced back to its original position
after the cement has dried, by a rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
revolving wheel of a “channel laying machine.”
In this way the stitches are
hidden.</p>

<p>Welt shoes are stitched on in three
different ways: “channeled,” which, when
finished, leaves an invisible stitch on the
bottom of the sole; “regular stitched aloft,”
showing the stitches on both sides; and
“fudge stitched,” in which the seam is
sunk down in a groove, being almost
invisible from the welt side.</p>

<p>Every stitch must be of such a nature
that it is independent of the one next to it,
so that should one stitch break, the others
will not work loose. This is accomplished
by running the threads through a pan of hot
wax just before entering the leather, which
causes the waxed thread to solidify, becoming,
as it were, a part of the leather.</p>

<p>Notice should be taken of the difference
between the way the outsole is stitched
and the inner sole is stitched to the upper.
In place of three threads in the chain stitch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
“that holds the welt to the upper and
insole” there are but two here&mdash;an upper
and a lower one. The upper thread extends
only part way down, where it loops, twists,
and locks into the lower thread. This is
the reason why you can wear a welt sole
clear through without its pulling loose.</p>

<p>Shoes that are stitched aloft go through
the same operations as the channel-stitched
shoes, with the exception that the rounding
machine contrivance of cutting is eliminated.</p>

<p>Shoes that are to be fudge stitched are
sent through the same machine as the regular
stitched aloft, but an additional little
knife point on the arm of the Goodyear
stitcher digs a channel in the welt so that
the stitches on that side are sunk into the
leather.</p>

<p>The outsole is nailed at the heel after
the stitching on the “loose nailing machine,”
which drives the nails through the outsole
and insole and clinches against the steel
plate of the last. The machine drives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
separate nails fed from the hopper of any
desired size or length, at the rate of three
hundred and fifty per minute.</p>

<p>The edge of the outsole around the
heel is now trimmed to conform exactly
to the shape of the heel on the “heel seat
pounding machine.”</p>

<p>The stitches of the regular stitched shoes
are separated by a series of indentations,
giving the shoe that corrugated effect which
adds so much to the appearance of the shoe.
In the fudge-stitched work the stitches are
entirely covered up by the indentations.</p>

<p>Then a leveling machine, called the
“automatic sole leveling machine,” with
a pressure of about two and a half tons to
each of the concave rollers, comes into
play. The rolls move automatically back
and forth and from side to side, doing the
work that the shoemaker used to do on his
lap with a hammer and stone, but doing it
better and more quickly. It practically
levels off the bottom of the soles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>An automatic guage regulates exactly
the distance from the edge of the last, and
by the use of this machine the operator is
enabled to make a sole conform to that of
all others of a similar design and size.</p>

<p>Heels are formed by cementing different
lifts of leather. A machine called a “heel
cutter” shapes out the lifts. The heel is
then placed under pressure, giving it exact
form and greatly increasing its wear.</p>

<p class="caption">Heel Shaping. <i>See <a href="#Page_138">page 138</a>.</i></p>
</div>

<p>In speaking of the ends and sides of a
heel, the part that rests on the ground is
spoken of as the top, and the first piece is
called the top lift. The part that is fastened
to the shoe is spoken of as the bottom,
while the side nearest the toes is called the
breast. The wedge is a flat, heel-shaped
piece or lift of leather that is skived to a
thin edge at the breast. Being thicker at
the back, it tips the heel forward. Wedges
are made from thin strips of waste leather,
or from sheets of leather board, and are cut
out with a hollow die. The gouges are cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
in the sole leather room from scraps, and
are a regular heel lift, having a horseshoe-shaped
piece of leather with an opening at
the breast.</p>

<p>The sole leather, insoles, counters, and
heels, in the stock fitting department are
“got out” by being cut into shape by a
machine die.</p>

<p>The heel is now trimmed of all rough and
surplus portions of leathers to the exact
size of top lift. A blower attached to the
machine removes all scraps, etc.</p>

<p>The breast of the heel, which faces the
forepart of the shoe, is trimmed evenly
across and with the desired slant by means
of a peculiar-shaped knife which extends
over the sole at shank. The edges of the
heel are now scoured by revolving rolls
with molded sandpaper to make perfectly
smooth. Blowers attached to the machine
remove all dust.</p>

<p>There are several types of machines for
fastening the heel to the shoe, all very rapid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
in operation. One of the latest is that
which feeds the nails, and which is operated
by a man and boy, who together turn off a
great quantity of work.</p>

<p>The nails are left protruding slightly above
the heel so as to retain the top lift, which is
now placed in position by the same operator
on the same machine. It is pressed down
over the heads of the nails securing it in
position. The small brass or steel nails
which protect and ornament the heel are
now driven in by the “universal slugging
machine.” This machine cuts the slugs
from a coil of wire and drives them in with
great rapidity.</p>

<p>We have practically now a roughly formed
shoe ready for the finishing room.</p>

<p>Here the heel slugs are ground down,
heel and sole buffed by sandpaper rolls on a
scouring machine, wet down, stained, or
blacked, as case may be, finished on bristle
brushes, placed to dry, polished by a
polishing machine, bottom stamped with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
the trademark, and passed to an operator
whose duty it is to see that no tacks are
left inside the shoes. Generally girls are
hired to do this, as their hands are smaller
and it is very important that no tacks are
left, which might cause a great deal of
trouble. If any are found, they are cut out
with nippers or otherwise removed.</p>

<p>A lining is also generally put inside the
shoe, covering the whole of the insole in
a McKay shoe, and the heel only in a
Goodyear shoe. Shoes must also be inspected
here before they are packed, to
see if they are perfect in every way and
that each shoe is a perfect mate in the
pair.</p>

<p>The shoes are now sent to the last department,
called treeing, dressing, and packing
department.</p>

<p>This department has to do with the
finishing of the uppers. The bottoms and
edges are all finished when shoes get to
this department, and nothing remains but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
to finish the uppers and pack the shoes in
single-pair cartons and then in wooden
boxes or cases.</p>

<p>The different uppers are all finished by a
different process, some being ironed with a
hot iron, which is done to take out the
wrinkles and smooth the uppers. Ironing
was first introduced on kid shoes, but in
recent years the hot iron has been put on
nearly all kinds of stock. A shoe must be
on a form or tree when ironed, the form or
tree being the same shape as the last. The
whole idea in ironing is the same as that
followed by the tailor, who uses a hot iron
to press and smooth out clothes. The
operations in detail are as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus23" style="width: 420px;">

<img src="images/illus24.jpg" width="420" height="330" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Packing.</p>
</div>

<p>Each shoe is treed, after having been
drawn over a foot form similar to that on
which the shoe was lasted, and any stain or
dirt which may have been carelessly put on
in former operations is cleaned off; the
shoe is sponged with a gum prepared for
either black or tan goods, rubbed down dull,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
and then rubbed to a polish. In many
patent leather shoes the treeing is to clean
off the surface, as we said before, and then
to iron it with a hot iron, which takes out
all stains, and leaves the leather shiny and
black.</p>

<p>The shoes finally go to hand operators,
who rag the edges and heels, leaving them
ready to be laced and put into the boxes.
After lacing, the shoes are passed to inspectors,
whose duty it is to see that they are
perfect, to throw out all which are not,
make a record of them, and pass the perfect
shoes to the packers, who see that the sizes
are right, that each pair is mated, and placed
in paper cartons, ready to be packed in
wooden cases for shipment. The packing of
cartons into wooden cases is done by men
who nail on the lid when each case is full,
mark where goods are to be sent, make a
record of same and load the cases into
freight cars.</p>

<p>There are other uppers that are treed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
such as wax calf, for instance, and split
uppers, which are used in heavy shoes.
The main idea of treeing a shoe is to give
it a smooth and finished appearance and a
good “feel.” In the regular treeing operation
they use liquid preparations, often
called composition, and these are worked
into the upper, filling it to some extent.
French chalk is used a great deal in some
uppers, and oil or some form of grease or
gum is also used, all of which make the
upper as it was when first put on the cutting
board of the shoe factory. All work done
in this room is intended to give leather its
original luster, which has been lost to a
certain extent in going through the different
rooms and in being handled so much.</p>

<p>There are still other uppers that may not
be treed or ironed but merely cleaned and
polished to give luster. Some of these may
be dressed. To dress a shoe means to put
on a liquid dressing. In some cases two
coats of dressing are put on and in other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
cases one coat. A shoe can have a dull
dressing or a bright dressing, according to
how the buyer prefers to have his shoes
look.</p>

<span class="smaller">McKAY AND TURNED SHOES</span></h2>

<p>The McKay process is used very
extensively in the manufacture of
cheap shoes. Its introduction was a great
improvement over the nailing and pegging
of the soles to the uppers. It allows
the two to be stitched together by means
of a straight needle running through the
entire thickness of upper, sole, and insole.</p>

<p>In following the McKay process through
the factory, we find it very similar to the
Goodyear welt process, which has been
explained, the main difference being in the
methods of fastening the sole to the uppers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus25" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/illus25.jpg" width="420" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Cross Sections of Welt Shoe and McKay Sewed Shoe.</p>
</div>

<p>The lasts and patterns are obtained in
the same manner as described in the previous
chapter. The order is made out in the
factory office, and the ticket is given to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
sorter, who selects the required number of
skins, which he rolls in a bundle and turns
over to the cutter. The cutters form the
various pieces of leather and linings, which
are tied up in bundles and sent to the
stitching room. Here they pass through
the various sewing machines, finally coming
out in the form of a complete upper ready
to be attached to the bottoms.</p>

<p>The soles, insoles, counters, and heels
for McKay shoes are all formed in the same
room, as described in the Goodyear process.</p>

<p>There is a difference in making ready the
outsoles and insoles. It will be recalled
that the outsole for the Goodyear welt
shoe was simply a block of leather cut to
fit the shoe and was not channeled. The
outsole for the McKay shoe is run through
a channeling machine, which cuts a slit
around the edge of the sole, folds the
leather back, and digs a little trench along
the inside of the slit. It will also be remembered
that the insole of the Goodyear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
welt shoe was channeled with two slits, one
of which was turned back to form the breast
for sewing on the welt strip. The insole of
a McKay shoe is not channeled in any way,
but is left plain, like the outsole of the
Goodyear welt. The uppers, the soles,
insoles, counters, and heels all having been
made ready, the pieces are taken to the
lasting room.</p>

<p>The first process is called “assembling.”
The operator takes up one of the uppers,
inserts the last, sticks in a counter between
the lining and the outside, puts in a “box”
(a stout piece of canvas to give stability
to the toe) at the toe, beneath the tip, puts
in the insole, and then may pull the shoe
tight on the last or give it to the operator
on the pulling over machine to have it
done. The pulling over machine is now
used in nearly all factories, having displaced
hand pulling the same as the lasting
machines have displaced hand lasting. The
assembling, pulling, and lasting on the machine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
are all parts of the regular operation
of lasting. The hand laster had to do all
three parts in former times, but now there
are machines to do nearly everything, and
at the present time the operation of lasting
is divided into assembling, pulling over, and
lasting on the machine. But even these
machines do not do it all, as there is surplus
upper to be cut away, toes to be pounded
down, and filling to be put in the bottom,
all of which are done on a McKay shoe before
the sole can be laid. There are machines
to do these parts, too.</p>

<p>A trimmer (this is done by hand) now
takes the shoe, trims off all the surplus
leather, tacks in the shank (a little piece
of steel to give rigidity to the shank of the
sole), fills all up smoothly and then passes
it to the sole layer, who puts on the outer
sole and tacks it in place.</p>

<p>The last is now pulled out of the shoe
and it is ready for the McKay sewing
machine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>This machine sews right through the
inner and outer sole, and at the same time
catches the edges of the upper leather and
the lining in between the two and draws
them all snugly and firmly together. The
stitches are made right along in the channel
of the outer sole, which is deep enough to
admit the row of stitches without raising
a ridge on the outside of the sole, after
the channel is closed up and leveled. The
channel is next filled with cement and
passed on to the leveler, which turns down
the loosened flap of leather, presses it all
out smooth, and covers the seam up so
completely that no trace of the sewing is
to be seen. This little folded-over flap of
leather serves the double purpose of hiding
the stitches in the sole, and at the same
time protecting them from wear against
the ground.</p>

<p class="caption">Tacking.</p>
</div>

<p>The shoe is then ready to be heeled, and
from here to the shipping door the McKay
generally goes through the same process as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
a welt. After heeling, the McKay shoes are
relasted or have followers put in to keep
them in shape while going through. The
sock lining may be put in here, too, before
relasting, or it may not be put in till the
shoes get to another room. The McKay
lasting last must be pulled from the shoe
to have the bottoms and heels put on and
this also applies to a pegged or nailed shoe.
But in the case of a welt shoe or a turn
shoe, both stay on the original last until
the bottoms and heels have been fastened
on. The turn shoe being lasted inside out,
must come off the last to be turned right
side out, and it goes right on the last as
soon as it can be turned. The different
methods of fastening the bottoms constitute
the main difference between Goodyear and
turn shoes on the one hand, and McKay,
pegged, and nailed on the other. The
bottom stock must be prepared differently
in order to fit the methods. Thus it is
seen that only two departments are affected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
namely, the sole leather and the making
departments. In the cutting, stitching,
finishing, treeing, and packing, all operations
are practically the same on every shoe, no
matter how it is bottomed. The patterns,
however, by which shoes are cut may be
different.</p>

<p>In the finishing room all of the finishing
of the bottoms and heel edges is done. The
heels are sandpapered or scoured, and are
then blacked and polished under hot-iron
pressure. Considerable wax is used on
the edge and is melted by the hot iron.
Heel edges may also be finished on a wheel
or roll. There are several different ways,
but the object of each method is to give a
hard, black, and highly polished surface to
the edge.</p>

<p>In finishing the bottom the top lift is
scoured or buffed, and all of the sole and
the breast of the heel also. Each is a
different process, a different operator attending
to each part. The object of scouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
or buffing with sandpaper is to get a smooth
foundation for the finish, which is put on
next, and which may be all the same color
in all parts of the bottom or may have one
color in the shank and another in the forepart.
The stains and blackings are used
on bottoms, and these are brought to a
high, hard gloss by means of rolls and
brushes. Hot irons are often used on black
shanks and bottoms to give added hardness
and luster to the finish.</p>

<p>The turned or turn shoe is a woman’s
fine shoe that is made wrong side out,
then turned right side out. The sole is
fastened to the last, and the upper is
twisted over, the wrong side out. Then
the two are sewed together, the thread
catching through a channel or shoulder
cut in the edge of the sole. The seam does
not come through to the bottom of the sole,
nor to any part inside where it would chafe
the foot.</p>

<p>The preparation of the upper for a turn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
shoe is identical with that of a welt or
McKay, with the exception that the back
is cut a little longer and a little larger, in
order to last it over the sole. The important
difference in the make-up of a turn
shoe as compared with that of a McKay or
welt is that it has no insole, the upper
being sewed directly to a portion of the
sole itself.</p>

<p>As the cutting of the uppers and the
stitching operations of a turn shoe are the
same as the Goodyear and McKay, and
have been explained, we will take up the
forming of the sole, which is entirely
different from either of the other two
methods.</p>

<p>A turn shoe is put together wrong side out,
and it is necessary, during the course of making,
to turn it by rolling the sole up like a roll
of carpet. It is evident, then, that nothing
but good quality, pliable leather can be
used satisfactorily, and great care is taken
to include nothing but the best.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>The soles are cut out on the beam machines,
also previously described. They are
then channeled on the side that is next
to the foot. This channeling is similar to
that done on the welt insole. Two incisions
are made, the inside one being the
same as in the welt insoles. The outside one,
however, is different, as the flange is cut
off square instead of being rolled up. This
leaves a channel which begins at the edge
and surface of the sole and extends in
semicircular form to the abrupt wall of the
cut in the sole, which forms the breast
against which the upper is to be sewed.</p>

<p>After the soles are channeled, they are
soaked until they become soft enough to
roll up easily. They are then placed on
racks and kept in a damp room until needed.</p>

<p>A turn shoe is hand lasted wrong side out.
First the uppers are turned with the lining
outside, then the last is inserted and also
the toe boxing.</p>

<p>The sole is set straight on the last and is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
tacked firmly to it. The operator, by aid
of hand pullers, draws the upper over the
sole and tacks it securely from a point
where the breast of the heel will rest to
where the large toe will extend, and then
along the same distance on the other side.
The toe part is next lasted by machinery,
a wire being fastened at one side and run
around the edge holding the pulled-up
parts of the upper which has been stretched
tightly over the last.</p>

<p>The shoe is next passed over to the Goodyear
inseamer operator, who sews the upper
to the sole, the needle passing down through
the inside channel, through the sole leather,
out through the square-cut channel and
then through the upper, uniting the upper
to the sole with the chain stitch. In fact,
the bottom of a turn shoe at this time looks
exactly like the bottom of a welt, with the
exception that the turn shoe is still turned
wrong side out. The nature of the stitch
is the same&mdash;a waxed, threaded chain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
with two rows of thread on the outside that
loop with the single thread in the inside
lip of the insole. The shoe is sewed only
from the back of the shank to the toe, the
heel part still being loose.</p>

<p>The seam is now trimmed with an inseam
trimmer, a machine with a revolving, jagged-edged
knife that saws off the surplus portions
of the upper, leaving it smooth and even
with the sole. The tacks are all pulled
out with a sort of a nail puller, which works
rapidly and automatically.</p>

<p>The lasts are then taken out and the
shoe is turned right side out. This turning
process is not a difficult one, but it is
perhaps the most interesting operation that
the layman will see in the entire factory.
The operation is accomplished by means
of a rigid iron bar set slantwise in a table.
The upper is turned right side out by hand
and the sole is rolled right side out by means
of pressure on this bar.</p>

<p>After this turning process, which twists<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
and rolls the shoe out of shape, it has no
semblance of its final form. The back part
of the sole and upper are still loose, the
upper being fastened from the shank to
the toe.</p>

<p>The turn shoe must be “second” lasted,
and the inserting of the last is no easy matter.
A contrivance called a push jack assists
the operator greatly. He uses a flat, narrow
rod to smooth out the lining, and
after squeezing, pushing, and smoothing,
the last is finally made to fit in the shoe.
The counter is placed in at this time, the
shank piece is set in place, and the shoe
and last are placed on a jack for nailing.
The back part upper is now stretched tightly
over the heel part of the last by means of
lasting pullers, and is tacked down, the
nails going through the shank piece and
clinching against the anvil heel seat of the
last. This operation completes the lasting,
the shoe now having a form exactly like
the last over which it is made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Workmen now level the bottoms and
form the shank by a hand method, preparatory
to the machine leveling process.
The shoe is still wet and is left to dry on
the last twenty-four hours. Then it is run
through the machine called the “leveler,”
which, with its enormous pressure, forms
the sole to that of the last. The shoes are
now left four days on the lasts, to dry
thoroughly, so that they may retain their
shape permanently.</p>

<p>The putting on of the heel, and the
various finishing processes are practically
the same as that of the welt, with the
exception that a turn sole must have a
sock lining.</p>

<p>Some factories use a grain leather sock
lining, which is pasted in, covering up the
channels of the sole which hold the stitches
and forming a smooth surface for the foot
to rest upon.</p>

<p>The difference between a McKay and a
turn shoe may be told by the fact that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
stitching on the inside of the sole is much
closer to the edge in a turn. Another
thing, in a turn shoe, the seam connecting
the upper and the outsole can be seen.</p>

<p>Nothing is likely to excel the turn shoe
for lightness and flexibility, since the method
of making, whereby the sole is stitched
directly to the upper, interposes no thick
or cumbersome material. Sole leather of
good quality is used. In fact, the sole
would have to be not only strong, but thin
and light, or the shoe could not be turned
in the process of manufacture without
straining it and getting it out of shape.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">History of the Turn Shoe</span></h3>

<p>History states that prior to 1845, which
marked the date of the introduction of
shoe machinery, most of the shoes were
sewed by hand, the lighter ones turned
and the heavier ones welted. In fact, the
early factories that began to spring up in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
New England about the beginning of the
century, were merely cutting rooms and
places for storing the lasts and stock.</p>

<p>Here the uppers, soles, and linings were
cut by hand and then given out to people
in the vicinity, mostly farmers and fishermen,
to be stitched together and paid for at so
much a dozen. Such was the beginning of
the shoe industry in New England. Hundreds
of families added to their resources
in this way, the women doing the lighter
work and the men the heavier.</p>

<p>In fishing communities, where men were
away most of the time in their boats,
their wives and daughters, who stayed at
home, undertook the lighter grades of
shoemaking&mdash;the turn process. This was
the case in the “North Shore” towns like
Lynn, Haverhill, and Marblehead, and these
to-day, keeping to the old traditions, are the
great centers for the finer turn-grades of
shoemaking, whereas the “South Shore”
towns, like Brockton, Whitman, Abington,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Rockland, and the Weymouths, with the
men at home all the year, came to make a
specialty of shoes for men, and absorbed
the heavier part of the growing industry.</p>

<p>With the introduction of the Goodyear
turn machine, however, the handwork was
gradually done away with, although more
handwork is done in the turn process than
in either the McKay or welt process.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Standard Screw Shoemaking</span></h3>

<p>Many good qualities of heavy shoes are
made by the standard screw method, which
differs from the McKay method by having
the outsole and insole fastened together
with a double-threaded wire, which is
screwed through and cut off by the machine
the instant it reaches the inside of the shoe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus28" style="width: 420px;">
<img src="images/illus28.jpg" width="420" height="650" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Cross Section of Standard Screwed Shoe.</p>
</div>

<p>A pegged shoe is made in much the same
way as the standard screw, except that
wooden pegs are used instead of wire to
fasten the sole together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>The nailed method of shoemaking consists
in nailing the soles together around the
edge. It is used principally for heavy,
cheap shoes.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_EIGHT">CHAPTER EIGHT<br />
<span class="smaller">OLD-FASHIONED SHOEMAKING AND REPAIRING</span></h2>

<p>The old-fashioned shoemaker formerly
made shoes by hand as follows:&mdash;A
last, which is a wooden model of a
foot, was used, and pieces of leather were
pasted here and there on it so as to build
up a model conforming to the measurements
of the foot. Then paper patterns of the
upper leather were made from the last, and
from these the upper leathers were cut out
of tanned calfskins and sewed together.</p>

<p>The leather for the soles was cut out of
tanned ox or steer hide, the pieces being
the insole, the outsole, and the lifts of
the heel. The inner soles were made of
softer leather. Sometimes split sole leathers
were used for uppers. The shoemaker
then softened the leather by steeping it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in water, until it was pliable and at the
same time firm, and would cut like cheese.</p>

<p>The insoles were attached to the bottom
of a pair of wooden lasts, and the wet
leather fastened on with lasting tacks so
as to mold it to the last. When it was
dry, the shoemaker with pincers drew the
leather out until it had taken the exact
form of the bottom of the last. Then he
rounded the soles by paring down the edges
close to the last, and formed around these
edges a small channel or feather cut or slit
about an eighth of an inch in the leather.</p>

<p>Next he pierced the insoles all around
with a bent awl, which “bit” into, but not
through, the leather, and came out at the
channel or feather edge. The boots were
then lasted by placing the uppers on the
lasts, drawing the edges by means of
pincers tightly round the edge of the insoles.
Then they were fastened in portions with
lasting tacks. Lasting was considered a
very important operation, for unless the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
upper was drawn smoothly and equally
over the last, leaving neither a crease nor
wrinkle, the form would be a failure. A
band of flexible leather about an inch wide,
with one edge pared, was then placed in
position around the sides of the shoes, up
to the heel or seat, and the maker proceeded
to “inseam,” by passing his awl through
the holes, already made in the insole,
catching with it the edge of the upper and
the thin edge of the welt, and sewing all
three together in one flat seam, with a
waxed thread.</p>

<p>The threads which shoemakers use are
called “ends,” and are made of two or
more strands of small flaxen threads. The
shoemaker makes his own waxed thread as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>He holds the main part of the thread
from the spool, in his left hand, holding it
firmly&mdash;where he wants to break it&mdash;between
the first finger and thumb, so
that it will not turn beyond that point.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
Then with the left hand, he lays the end
of the flax on the knee and rolls it from
him. This will cause the small fibers that
compose the thread to separate&mdash;thus
enabling him to break it easily. When
the fibers separate, he gives the thread a
light, quick turn, which causes it to break.
As the thread breaks he pulls it apart
gradually, so that the fibers will taper.
Then he places the threads together, one
just behind the other, so that the end will
have a very fine point. He rolls the end
and allows it to turn between the fingers
of the left hand. After it has been rolled
and twisted, it is waxed by drawing the
thread through a piece of wax.</p>

<p>The fine ends are waxed to a point. A
bristle is fastened on in the following
manner: the head of the bristle is held in
the left hand, and the portion to which the
thread is to be fastened is waxed; then the
thread and bristle are twisted together. A
hole is made in the thread and the bristle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
pulled through and fastened. After the
threads are fastened, the heads of the bristle
are cut off, and the ends sandpapered.</p>

<p>The wax thread or “end,” as it is called,
should never be made longer than is necessary
to sew a shoe. Experience shows that
if a portion of an end left after sewing one
shoe is used on the second shoe, it is never
as strong as a new end. The thread grows
weaker and weaker as it is used. When
the thread is well waxed, it is cemented to
the shoe.</p>

<p>After the shoe is sewed, the shoemaker
pares off inequalities and levels the bottoms,
by filling up the depressed part in the
center with pieces of tarred felt. The
shoes are now ready for the outsoles.
The fibers of the leather to be used for
the soles are thoroughly condensed by
hammering on the lapstone. Then they
are fastened through the insole with steel
tacks, their sides are pared, and a narrow
channel is cut round their edges. Through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
this channel they are stitched to the welt,
about twelve stitches of strong, waxed
thread being made to the inch. The soles
are next hammered into shape; the heel
lifts are put on and attached with wooden
pegs. Then they are sewed through the
stitches of the insoles; and the top pieces,
similar to the outsoles, are put on and
nailed down to the lifts.</p>

<p>The finishing operations of the shoe
include smoothing the edges of the heel,
paring, rasping, scraping, smoothing, blacking,
and burnishing the edges of the
soles, withdrawing the lasts, and cleaning
out any pegs which may have pierced
through the inner sole. There are numerous
minor operations connected with forwarding
and finishing in various materials,
such as punching holes, inserting eyelets, etc.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">How Shoes are Repaired</span></h3>

<p>Before one can understand how shoes are
repaired, it is necessary to know the difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
between the inside and outside of a
shoe.</p>

<p>The last is divided into four parts, viz.
toe, ball, shank, and heel.</p>

<p>Diagram No. 1 shows these parts and
their shapes.</p>

<p>Diagram No. 2 shows the length of the
inside of the divisions as compared with
those of the outside. Notice the long
shank and short ball.</p>

<p>Diagram No. 3 shows the outside of the divisions
and the effect they have upon the shape
of the shoe. See short shank and long ball.</p>

<p>Always remember that the ball of a shoe
is longer on the outside, having a short
shank. The ball is shorter on the inside,
having a long shank. Compare outside
and inside diagrams Nos. 2 and 3.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Shoe Repairing</span></h3>

<p>The first operation in half soling a shoe is
to cut off the old portion from “a” to “c”
as shown on diagram No. 1. The shoe is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
placed in different positions and corrected
in every way before putting on the new sole.
It is generally better to wet the shoe in
order to put it in shape.</p>

<p>The leather is skived thin and accurate
enough to make a neat, comfortable joint,
and yet thick enough for the nails to hold.</p>

<p>Then the filling is added before placing
on the sole. The sole is trimmed and a
guide line drawn around the edge, so that
the nails may be properly arranged.</p>

<p>Finishing the sole is an important part.
If everything else is properly done, this
part becomes comparatively easy. See that
all nails are clinched. With a level bottom,
smooth joints and edges, the shoe can be
made to look like a new shoe and yet feel
like an old one.</p>

<p>On account of the heel being more directly
under the body and the first part to strike
the ground, it generally wears out first.
For this reason in repairing a heel great
care must be taken to see that good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
leather and solid work are put into it.
Pull off the worn top piece and see that
what is left is hammered down solidly.
Next split a piece of solid, easy-cutting,
scrap sole leather, so that two pieces can
be made out of one. Put them on the
shoe and fasten them on well, piece by
piece, with tacks. See that the heel is
level before putting on the top piece.
(If necessary, a small piece may be put
under the top piece.) After it is level,
put on top piece, trim in shape, then draw
guide line and nail down. The nails are
placed thicker on the side that is worn
down most, to protect the heel. The heel
is next rasped, and smoothed with a buffer
and sandpaper. When finished, it should
set level.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Modern Method of Repairing Shoes</span></h3>

<p>As the shoemaking industry has become
more and more perfect, there has been an
increasing interest taken in shoe repairing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
A medium-priced shoe as it is made to-day
may often be in good enough condition to
be heeled and soled a couple of times.
Hence, although in the past many shoe
stores and departments have had their
shoe repairing done by outside shops, the
tendency to-day is for every shoe store
to have its own repair department. This
method has resulted largely from the
development of machinery for shoe repairing,
which is revolutionizing the business
to such an extent that in a few years
repairing by hand will be among the lost
arts. With the new inventions for restoring
upper leather, and the improvement of
machinery for shoe repairing, repair departments
will very soon be but little short
of miniature factories.</p>

<p>The machinery ordinarily used consists
of the Goodyear stitcher, used for attaching
soles to Goodyear welts by the lock-stitch
method, just as in shoe factories making
Goodyear welt shoes. Then there is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
heel trimmer, a bottom finisher, consisting
of a rapidly revolving roll covered with
coarse and fine sandpaper, and an opera
heel builder for forming concave heels.
There are two wheels used for tan and
white heel work, one heel being covered
with a white cloth, and the other with a
coarse brush. Adjoining these are usually
the shank and heel finisher,&mdash;capable of
smoothing and highly polishing a shank or
heel in about a dozen seconds,&mdash;the bottom
finisher, that grinds and smooths down the
new sole, and a machine used for rubbing
off dirt before the shoe is finished, consisting
of a heavy horsehair brush. Another useful
part of the equipment is an edge setter,
which is also identical with the one used in
factories. The shoe stitching machines
and the parts used in finishing are all
operated on one long shaft, rapidly revolved
by the aid of a motor. It is a fact that a
shoe may be actually soled and heeled in
less than six minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span></p>

<p>Five or six men are usually employed in
the repair department of a large establishment.
When the customer’s shoes are
brought in, one of these men cuts off the
old sole and traces an outline of the new
sole on a block of the very best oak leather.
After these are cut out by hand in rough
form, they are soaked in water and channeled;
that is to say, a part of the sole is
turned up in which the stitches are to be
run. A second man, by the use of the
Goodyear stitcher, joins the sole and welt
together with a very strong and tightly
drawn lock stitch. This is a large machine
with a curved, barbed needle and awl, and
a shuttle which sews through an inch of
leather with the greatest ease and speed.
There are from one hundred and fifty to
two hundred stitches in each shoe; moreover,
every one of them is locked with
heavy wax thread, so that there is no chance
of their ever giving away. If one stitch
should break, the other stitches would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
remain intact, as they are all independent
of each other. Both soles are stitched on
in a little over half a minute without
breaking a thread or stopping the machine.</p>

<p>A coating of rubber cement is now placed
in the edges of the outsole, and the lip of
the channel is smoothed down so that the
stitches are entirely hidden when looking at
the bottom of the shoe. The edge trimming
is done next with the aid of a rapidly revolving
wheel, which trims the edges square
and true in about forty seconds. After this,
the shank is finished on a rapidly revolving
wheel covered with emery cloth.</p>

<p>Bottom finishing is the next step. This
is done on a machine having two long
cylinders, one covered with fine and the
other with coarse sandpaper. These cylinders
revolve rapidly, and the operator uses
the coarse sandpaper for scouring the dirt
and old finish off the leather, and the
fine sandpaper for finishing the sole as
smooth as that of any new shoe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The brushing in or smoothing is next
done by the horsehair brush we have mentioned
before. A preparation called Lewis’s
rival bottom polish&mdash;a sort of white wax&mdash;is
placed on the brush machine. The
brush now smooths the surface of the sole,
filling in all small holes with wax and leaving
the sole absolutely perfect. Finally, the
shoe is placed against a rapidly revolving
brush which finishes the uppers with a
luster that would make any ordinary boot-black
green with envy. Another operation
that fully completes the process is the
hardening of the edges with hot steel,
which ends in producing an edge that is as
hard as iron. When it is polished with a
black dye, it looks exactly like a new sole.</p>

<p>A few words are necessary with regard
to the heel. The old heel having been
removed, several lifts of new leather in
rough form are tacked on. The shoe is
then taken to the heel trimmer and is
formed correctly and then smoothed down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
to a brilliant surface on the finely covered
revolving wheel. In a few seconds it is
stained, smoothed, and polished. In less
than six minutes the shoe is ready for the
customer.</p>

low shoe, with vamp extended into a flaring
tongue, with a large, ornamental buckle
across the instep. The buckle and tongue
are the distinctive features of the shoe,
whether the shoe fastens with a lace or
strap.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Coltskin.</span> Coltskin has been brought
into general use in shoemaking within the
past few years. The skin of a colt is thin
enough to use like calfskin in its entirety,
with such shaving as is given all hides in
tanning. Coltskin makes a firm basis
needed for patent leather, and has been
much used in recent years for this purpose.
Russia is the chief source of supply.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Combination Last.</span> One with a different
width instep from the ball. It may be
one or two widths’ difference, such as the
D ball with a B instep. Combination

insteps.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Composition.</span> A term used to denote<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
the small scraps that accumulate about
tanneries and factories, which are ground
up and mixed with a paste or a kind of
cement, and flattened into sheets which
are used as insoles, and in other parts, in
various grades of shoes, where wear is not
excessive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Congress Gaiter.</span> A shoe designed
especially for comfort, with rubber goring
in the sides which adjusts it to the ankle,
instead of laces, and sometimes made with
lace front to imitate a regular shoe.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cordovan.</span> Originally a Spanish leather
made from horsehide. The Spaniards were,
for a great many centuries, the best leather
makers. The term is applied to a grain
leather from the best and strongest part of
a horsehide.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Counter.</span> The stiffening in the back
part of a shoe, often called stiffening, to
support the outer leather and prevent the
shoe from “running over” at the heel. It
is made either of sole leather, shaved thin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
on the edge and shaped by machinery, as
in the best shoes, or composition or paper,
in cheap shoes. Metal is occasionally used
on the outside of the shoes in heavy goods
for miners and furnacemen.</p>

<span class="smaller">LEATHER PRODUCTS MANUFACTURE</span></h2>

<p>The use of gloves is so old that relics
of them have been found in the
habitations of the cave dwellers. The
Romans used them as decorative articles
of dress and the Greeks to protect the hands
when doing heavy work.</p>

<p>The gloves of ladies and gentlemen in the
days of Queen Elizabeth, and before and
after, were most beautiful in hand workmanship
and embellishments, but they
were usually shapeless things, and in these
days no one would wear them; they are
not to be compared with the elegant style
and artistic finish of the modern product.</p>

<p>When the social world was restricted, so
to speak, in the numbers of its members who
could afford some of life’s luxuries, the use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
of the glove was confined largely to royalty,
nobility, and the well-to-do. And the trade
not being extensive, prices were high&mdash;being
added to by decorative elaboration
in needlework in order that the manufacturer
and his employees might extract as
much money as possible from the ultimate
buyer. While glove making is now one of
the stabilities of modern manufacture, it
is, nevertheless, constantly changing in
styles, due to eagerness for novelties and
new fashions.</p>

<p>Glove making of leather, in a rough,
crude form, was carried on in this country
to a very limited extent in New York State
as early as 1760, by glove makers brought
from Scotland to settle on the grants of
Sir William Johnson, in Fulton county.
But there was no general market for the
home product until one was found in Albany
in 1825. These early gloves, crude and
clumsy, were cut with shears from leather
by means of pasteboard patterns, and men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
did the cutting and women the sewing.
Dies were later introduced, and this led to
a great improvement in the character of
the output.</p>

<p>But a still greater step forward was taken
when the sewing machine was introduced
in 1852. This abolished handwork entirely,
but still the industry remained largely of
a domestic nature, since it could be carried
on at home with a machine as well as in a
factory. Later steam power was installed
in factories with which to run the machines.
The cutting of gloves, and the stitching
on the backs, was done before the gloves
were sent out to be completed in workers’
homes.</p>

<p>As in everything wherein power can be
substituted for hand labor in these days,
the methods of glove manufacture have
undergone a great transformation. The
treating of skins in a great tub, three feet
deep, whole dyeing and scouring, in rooms
of high temperature, has been displaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
by putting skins and colors into a cube-shaped
box, which, revolving with an irregular
motion, produces the same results more
quickly than by the primitive way. But
when color is to be applied to but one side
the process is the same as of old,&mdash;hand
use of a brush while the skin is stretched
out on a slab.</p>

<p>When taken from the stock on hand to
be made into gloves, the first thing done
to skins by some glove makers is to “feed”
them with eggs&mdash;not eggs of suspicious
merits, but good enough for table use. And
of these nothing is used but the yolk. One
glove maker imports from China large
quantities of the yolks of duck eggs for his
work, and his yearly consumption of yolks
amounts to seventeen thousand.</p>

<p>When the skins leave the dyehouse,
they are rapidly dried in steam-heated
lofts; and while stiff and rough they are, or
were, worked into softness and smoothness
over a wooden upright standard, called a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
stake, at the top of which is fitted a blunt
semicircular knife. Over this the skin is
drawn by hand, back and forth, until it
becomes as pliable and delicate as silk.
When this work was done manually it was
most laborious. But now it has been
mostly taken over by very ingenious machinery,
which looks, in operation, as if it would
tear a skin into fragments by the way it
snaps and pulls at it, but which is adjustable
to such nicety of action and power that the
work is done exactly as it is wanted.</p>

<p>The next operation is to pare the skins
to uniformity of thickness. This also was
handwork for a long time, done with a
peculiarly shaped knife, but now emery-coated
wheels, with rounded edges, are
used by the workers, who, with their aid,
do just as good and much faster work in
drawing and thinning the skins with absolute
precision. This completes the treatment
of the skin.</p>

<p>Now the function of the cutter begins,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
and he must be a workman of experience
and good judgment, in that he must contend
with the inconstant inelasticity of the skin,
reducing it to uniform resistance. He must
get so many pieces of glove size from each
skin, and suit the pieces to particular features
of the skin. When done with a skin
he must have left, as useless, only trifling
strips and shreds. The shapeliness of the
glove which a woman draws over her hand,
depends altogether upon the intelligence
and skill of the cutter. In American factories
the cutter is usually from some
glove-making center in Europe and from
a family whose occupation has been glove
making for centuries.</p>

<p>A punch next cuts these glove pieces
into shape, forming and dividing the fingers,
slitting the buttonholes, providing side
pieces for fingers and thumbs, and also
the fragments used for strengthening the
buttonholes. The sewing, formerly the
handiwork of women, is now done on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
machines of capacity for exceptionally fine
quality of intricate stitching. The number
of glove sizes made is sufficient to meet
every likely demand. When sewn, and the
buttons or fastenings put on, they pass
beneath the critical eye of an inspector for
scrutiny as to faults. Then they are finally
shaped on a hot metal hand, smoothed,
banded, boxed, and sent to the salesroom
for shipment.</p>

<p>The first and fourth fingers of a glove are
completed by gussets, or strips, sewed only
on the inner side; but the second and third
fingers require gussets on both sides to
complete the fingers. In addition to these,
small, diamond-shaped pieces are sewed in
at the roots of the fingers. Special care is
necessary in sewing in the thumb pieces,
as poorly made gloves usually give way at
this point.</p>

<p>Natural lined gloves are now common
enough, although it is not many years
since they were regarded as impracticable.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
These are made from pelts of various
animals with the hair left on the skin to
form the lining.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Automobile and Furniture Leather</span></h3>

<p>For automobile and furniture leather
only choice hides should be used. The
kind of hides generally employed for this
class of leather are French and Swiss, as
these run full and plump on the bellies, are
free from cuts on the flesh and are of clear
grain. The hides are trimmed before placing
them in the soaking pits, all useless
parts, such as nose, shanks, etc., being cut
away.</p>

<p>After remaining in soak for a day or two,
the hides are hauled out, fleshed, and
returned to the soaks for thorough softening.
When thoroughly soaked, they are toggled
and reeled into the first lime. The first
lime must be a weak, mellow lime, or a
harsh grain will show after the leather is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
tanned. The hides are reeled over into
stronger limes every day for seven days,
when they are ready for unhairing. After
coming from the limes, the hides should
go into a pit of soft water heated to about
ninety degrees Fahrenheit and left over
night before starting in to unhair. After
unhairing, they are thrown into a vat
of clean water and thoroughly worked out
on the grain to remove short hairs and scud
and are then ready for bating. One that
has a little bacterial action is preferred to
an acid bate. After bating, the hides are
given a good scudding on the grain and are
then ready for the tanning liquors.</p>

<p>The liquors are made of hemlock and oak
and are used very weak on the start. The
hides are suspended for a day in a liquor
not over six degrees specific gravity reading
in strength, and the following day shifted
over into a stronger liquor. The stock is
given stronger liquors every day until
tanned enough for splitting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>The stock is struck out smoothly and
brought to the machine for splitting. The
buffing is first taken away and sold for hat
bands, pocket-books, etc. The grains are
finished and the splits are returned to the
tanning liquors to be thoroughly tanned.
As soon as the splits are tanned, they are
washed up, drained, and then drummed
in the drum in a sumac liquor. They are
now scoured, and, after being well set out,
are given a good oiling with cod oil.</p>

<p>They are now tacked out on the frames
and dried out. They are next taken from
the frames and boarded by hand over the
table. The splits are taken to the japan
shop and are tacked out again and are
ready for the first coat of daub. Two coats
are applied. After each coat, the splits
are well rubbed down, when they receive
the slicker coat. The color coats are now
applied, and after drying out, the leather
is grained up and finished.</p>

<span class="smaller">RUBBER SHOE MANUFACTURE</span></h2>

<p>Examine the rubbers we wear during
the winter and stormy weather.</p>

<p>Rubber shoe coverings are made to protect
the shoe from water and snow and
may be in the form of either slippers or
arctics. The covering is rendered waterproof
by means of a compound rubber.</p>

<p>Rubber is the name given to a coagulated
milky juice obtained from many different
trees, vines, and shrubs that grow on that
part of the earth’s surface which forms a
band some three or four hundred miles on
either side of the equator.</p>

<p class="caption">Crude Rubber.</p>
</div>

<p>Rubber is graded commercially, according
to the district where it is found. In the
order of importance it may be divided into
three general sorts, viz., American, African,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
and Asiatic. The best and largest quantities
of rubber come from Brazil, along the
banks of the Amazon River. The countries
in the northern and western part of South
America, and the Central American States
and Mexico furnish considerable rubber.
Eastern and western Africa also produce
many kinds of rubber in large quantities,
though somewhat inferior to the Brazilian
product. The Asiatic rubbers are unimportant
in quantity, and, excepting the
rubber obtained from cultivated trees in
Ceylon, are decidedly inferior in quality.</p>

<p>The fluid rubber obtained from Brazil
is called Para and is used principally in
the manufacture of rubber footwear. The
method of gathering and coagulating the
rubber juice (called latex) varies in the
different countries. The native first clears
a space under a number of trees and proceeds
to tap the trees with a short-handled
ax, having a small blade, by cutting gashes
in the bark. A cup is fixed under each cut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to catch the fluid as it flows out. As fast
as the cups are filled, they are emptied
into a large vessel and carried to the camp
to be coagulated. A fire is started in a
shallow hole in the ground, and palm nuts,
which make a dense smoke, are thrown on.
An earthen cover which has a small opening
on top is placed over the fire, allowing the
smoke to escape through the opening. A
wooden paddle is first dipped in clay water
and then into the latex and then held over
the smoke. The heat coagulates a thin
layer of rubber on the paddle. It is dipped
again and again in the latex and smoked
each time. After being dipped many times,
a lump (called biscuit) of rubber is formed.
A cut is made in the biscuit and the paddle
removed. Then the rubber is ready for
market. The world’s crop of rubber in
1911 was about ninety thousand tons.</p>

<p>Few people realize the number of operations
necessary to produce from the crude
biscuit of India rubber the highly finished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
rubber shoe of to-day. Briefly stated, the
various steps are washing, drying, compounding,
calendering, cutting the various
parts, making or putting these parts together,
varnishing, vulcanizing, and packing.
Each of these processes requires a distinct
and separate department, and many of these
processes are subdivided into minor operations.</p>

<p>The huge stock of Para rubber, that is
rubber obtained from the Amazon section,
to be found in any of the leading rubber
factories counts well up into the thousands
of dollars. With rubber at or near $1.50
per pound, a stock of ten to fifty tons runs
up into the five or six figures.</p>

<p>This crude rubber, as it comes from the
Amazon, contains more or less dirt, pebbles,
and other foreign substances, which must
be removed.</p>

<p>The large cakes of crude rubber are first
broken up by a cracker machine, consisting
of two large, revolving steel cylinders,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
from which the product falls into pans or
trays. It goes then to a machine known as
a “washer” or “sheeter,” where it is run
between revolving cylinders, upon which a
continuous spray of clean water is maintained.
After being rolled into rough sheets,
it is put into a tank, from which it is taken
to the “beater” machine, in which water
runs continuously, and then it is washed
again and “sheeted out.” It is then dried
in one of two ways.</p>

<p>(1) The older way. The sheets are
hung over rods in a large room, and allowed
to dry in the air. To facilitate the same,
a fan or blower is often used to cause a
circulation and removal of the moisture-laden
air. This requires a period of from
one to two or three months.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus33" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/illus33.jpg" width="650" height="530" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Washing and Drying.</p>
</div>

<p>(2) The second method is called vacuum
drying. This process is gradually being
introduced, so that now probably more
rubber is dried in vacuum than by air.
The vacuum drier consists of a large iron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
cylinder filled with plates, through which
steam is allowed to circulate. The rubber
is placed on the plates and the air is exhausted
from the cylinder by means of an
air pump until very nearly twenty-six
degrees of vacuum are obtained. By this
process only from two to three hours are
required to produce perfectly dry rubber.</p>

<p>The making of a rubber shoe is not the
simple matter which might at first be
supposed. An ordinary rubber shoe consists
of at least seven or eight different
parts, sometimes twenty-one parts to a pair,
while a high-button gaiter has seventeen
distinct parts, and a rubber boot has twenty-three
different pieces. There are insoles,
outsoles, stays, piping, foxing, and a dozen
other different pieces, each one of which is
necessary to the proper construction of a
rubber shoe or boot. The thinner sheets
for the uppers are cut by hand, the deft
work of the cutters in following the patterns
outlined on the sheets being the result of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
years of practice. The sheets of rubber
from which the uppers and soles are cut
are at this stage of the work plastic and
very sticky. It is necessary on this account
to cut the various pieces one by one, and
keep them separate. The soles and some
of the heavier pieces are dried out by the
machine, and the heels are made by a special
machine, but by far the greater part is done
by wonderfully skilled hands. All of these
parts which go to make a shoe, or the
twenty-three parts which go into a boot,
are collected and sent to the making department,
which, in most factories, is a large
room containing several hundred operatives,
each working by herself, and bringing the
many separate parts into the fully finished
footwear.</p>

<p class="caption">Calender Room.</p>
</div>

<p>The sheets of rubber, after being dried,
are taken to the “compound” room, where
they are sprinkled with whiting, to prevent
sticking, and weighed. Next they are taken
into the calender room to a “mixer,” by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
means of which the rubber is combined
with other substances, which include sulphur,
litharge, whiting, lampblack, tar,
resin, lime, palm oil, and linseed oil.</p>

<p>There are different calendering machines.
The ones called the upper calenders form
sheets of rubber stock for the upper part of
the shoe. The soling calenders form the
stock for the sole or bottom part of the
shoe; other calender machines are used to
coat a layer of gum on one side of the
fabrics used for lining and various strips,
fillers, toe, and heel pieces. The gum
sheets are sent to the cutting room.</p>

<p>Generally, linings for nine pairs of shoes
are cut at once. The linings are cut both
by hand and by machine. Men who cut
with dies, by hand, stand at the bench and
use iron mallets, like those used in cutting
heels. Inner soles, heel pieces, and linings
are all cut by means of dies in the same
manner.</p>

<p>The edges of the several parts are spread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
with cement, and then the parts are taken
to the making room and distributed. In
the making department the boots and shoes
are put together. Women make the light
overshoes; men make the heavy ones.
Rubbers are made by women, but men put
on the outer soles.</p>

<p>Linings are first applied smoothly to a
wooden last and cemented together, the
cement side out. The rubber parts are
then stuck on and rolled firmly with a
small hand roller. Young women become
very skilled in this work, taking up the
several parts in rapid succession, placing
them accurately upon the last, and rolling
and pounding them firmly together.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus35" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/illus35.jpg" width="650" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Cutting Room.</p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the most interesting single process
is that of putting the rubber boot
together. This work is done by men, and
requires, in addition to accurate eyesight,
rapid and very deft movements of the hand
and considerable strength. No nails, tacks,
or stitching are required. The natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
adhesiveness of the rubber, assisted by the
use of rubber cement, holds the parts
solidly together.</p>

<p>In the making of the shoe the last is
covered with the various pieces which are
so made as to adhere where they are placed.
It is exact and nice work fitting all these
pieces perfectly, each edge overlapping just
so far and no farther. The lighter shoes
are made by women, but the heavy lumbermen’s
shoes, arctics, and especially the
boots, are made by men, for this work needs
strength as well as dexterity.</p>

<p>The goods which require varnishing are
put on racks and treated with a mixture of
boiled linseed oil, naphtha, and other
materials, which are applied with brushes,
and impart a gloss to the surface.</p>

<p>On vulcanizing boots and shoes, the
shoes are placed on racks supported by
iron cars, which are run over tracks into
the vulcanizing chamber. This consists
principally of a large room provided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
with a steam coil on the floor. The temperature
rarely exceeds two hundred
and sixty degrees Fahrenheit. In vulcanizing
shoes, the heat is increased gradually
from the beginning, about one hundred and
eighty degrees Fahrenheit, otherwise the
goods would be blistered, due to the rapid
evaporation of moisture and other volatile
constituents. They are kept in these
heaters from six to seven hours. This
causes a union of sulphur and rubber, which
is not affected by heat or cold.</p>

<p>They are wheeled on another truck to the
packing room, where they are inspected,
taken from the lasts, tied together in
pairs, or placed in cartons, as the case may
be. They are then sent to the shipping
room to be packed in cases ready to be
delivered to the cars waiting at a side track
of the railroad, or sent to the storehouse
until they shall be called for by the jobbers
or retail dealers.</p>

<p>An important branch of the rubber business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
is the manufacture of tennis shoes.
This is a generic term, which is applied to
all kinds of footwear having cloth tops and
rubber soles. As the name indicates, they
were first used in playing the game of
tennis, but they have come into very general
use as warm weather and vacation shoes,
and every year shows an increased popularity.
These shoes are made in a similar
manner to the rubber shoes, the rubber
soles being cemented to the cloth uppers and
vulcanized the same as the rubber overshoes.
Many different styles are made,
and each year shows some improvements in
the shapes, in the textiles which are used,
in the colors and combinations of soles and
uppers.</p>

<p>Rubber shoes should not be expected to
give satisfactory service unless properly
fitted. If too short, too narrow, or if worn
over leathers with extra heavy taps, or
unusually thick, wide soles, strains will be
brought upon parts not designed to stand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
them and the rubber will give way. Rubber
goods, particularly boots, if too large will
wrinkle and a continued wrinkling and
bending is liable to cause cracking.</p>

<p>Extreme heat or cold should be avoided.
Rubber boots or shoes should never be
dried by placing them near a heater of any
kind. If left near a stove, register, or
radiator, the rubber is liable to dry and
crack. If left out of doors in winter,
or in an extremely cold place, they will
freeze. Then when the warm foot is put
into them and the rubbers are worn, the
rubber will crack.</p>

<p>Oil, grease, milk, or blood will cause
rubber to decay in a very short time. If
spattered with any of these, the rubber
should be promptly and thoroughly cleaned
with warm water and soap.</p>

<p>The oil in leather tops will rot rubber,
so that care should be taken in storing and
packing to prevent the leather and rubber
from coming in contact.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span></p>

<p>Various heavy goods are advertised as
proof against snagging. It should be remembered,
however, that no rubber can be
made strong enough to be absolutely proof
against tearing or puncturing by extremely
sharp edges, such as stiff stubble, sharp-edged
rocks, broken glass, etc.</p>

<p>Mud, barnyard dirt, or filth of any kind
should never be allowed to dry on rubbers.
They should be cleaned as carefully as
leather boots or shoes.</p>

<p>Exposure to strong sunlight for any
length of time produces an effect on rubbers
similar to that of putting them near a stove
or radiator. Rubbers should not be left
in the sun to dry. When not in use they
should be kept in a cool, dark place.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Rubber Heels</span></h3>

<p>Rubber heels are generally made for
boots and shoes as follows. The compounded
rubber is sheeted on a calender<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
roll, on a drum, until several layers are
obtained, thus making a sheet of about one
inch in thickness. The heel is cut out from
this sheet by means of a die and placed in a
mold. It is there subjected to an extremely
high pressure, generally obtained by hydraulic
power. The plates of the press
are heated with live steam. The heels are
removed at the end of nine or ten minutes
and the sheet which was formerly nearly an
inch in thickness is now only about half
an inch and has by pressure been molded
into the shape of the heel desired, is semi or
partially vulcanized, and also is imprinted
upon the bottom with the name or other
brand of the company.</p>

<p>The cup-shaped portion of the heel is now
coated with a layer of rubber cement, and
firmly placed on the boot ready to go to
the vulcanizer, where vulcanizing of the
heel is then completed.</p>

<div class="figcenter" id="illus37" style="width: 650px;">
<img src="images/illus37.jpg" width="650" height="500" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Heel-making Department.</p>
</div>

<p>Many articles of rubber are vulcanized by
the use of chloride of sulphur, which process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
is sometimes known as “cold cure.” The
action of sulphur chloride itself is so violent
that it must be diluted, and for this purpose
carbon bisulfide is often used. In some
cases, as, for example, the manufacture of
tobacco pouches, the articles are submerged
for from one to two minutes in the liquid,
then removed and washed thoroughly. In
another case, as in the manufacture of some
kinds of rubber cloth, such as hospital
sheeting, the coated cloth is suspended in
a suitable room and the chloride of sulphur
and carbon bisulfide mixed and evaporated
by action of heat so that the cloth is subjected
to the action of vapor alone. Only
articles with comparatively thin walls can
be successfully vulcanized by the cold cure,
as at best the vulcanizing action of the
chloride is only superficial.</p>

<p>No account of vulcanization processes as
employed in the manufacture of rubber
goods is complete without the mention of
“steam cure.” A great variety of rubber<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
goods under the general term of mechanical
sundries are cured by this method. This
includes rubber matting, door mats, water
bottles, druggists’ sundries, etc. This process
consists in brief of submitting the
articles to be vulcanized to the action of
live steam for from half an hour to an hour,
or until the goods are thoroughly vulcanized.
The temperature and duration of time required
depend to a considerable extent
upon the thickness of the walls of the
article. In order to prevent the goods
from being pitted and damaged by the
action of steam, they are wrapped with
cloth or imbedded in pans of soapstone.
A great variety of rubber tubing is cured
by this method.</p>

<p>In rubber cloth making, the crude rubber
is put through the washing process, dried
and mixed with sulphur, litharge, coloring
matter, etc., and then is taken to the cement
room, where it is “cut” with naphtha,
forming a thick paste or dough. This is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
taken to the spreading room in large tubs
and fed into the roller machine, which is
like a long table made of steam pipes
placed horizontally in a single layer. Below
one end is a roll of cloth, which is passed
between two iron rollers on the end. The
dough is fed in between these rollers and
is spread smoothly over the cloth, which is
rolled up and removed to a heating room,
where it is unrolled and hung on racks, and
then subjected to sufficient heat to cause
the combination of the sulphur and rubber.</p>

<h3><span class="smcap">Chemistry in the Manufacture of
Rubber Goods</span></h3>

<p>Too much stress cannot be laid upon the
importance in all rubber factories of the
chemical department. During the last two
or three years there has been an unusual
development along these lines, and to-day
no factory for the manufacture of rubber
goods is complete that does not possess a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
well-equipped laboratory. Not only does
this department enable the manufacturer
to control the purity and uniformity of
his compounding ingredients and the innumerable
grades of crude rubber, but, what
is of even greater importance, it enables
him to inaugurate research work as applied
to his particular line of manufacture. This
part of laboratory work is already producing
results not only of scientific interest, but
of very great practical and economic value.
Still another rôle of the modern chemical
laboratory is to exercise a control over the
finished material, so that the manager of
the works may be in possession daily of
reasons for any variation detrimental to
the standard of his products.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_TWELVE">CHAPTER TWELVE<br />
<span class="smaller">HISTORY OF FOOTWEAR</span></h2>

<p>We find that primitive footwear, in
common with all other beginnings,
was of the crudest nature and took the
form of the simple sandal. It is probable
that man first protected his foot from
the rough way by simple pieces of hide,
which were bound to the bottom of the
foot. The sandal, among the most primitive,
is the type of footwear worn to-day.
The sandal was simply bound to the foot
by thongs of hides, which were brought
between the toes and tied around the ankle.</p>

<p>At about the Elizabethan period, shoemaking
had really become a very fine art.
Some foot creations were made by the
Court shoemakers that reflected the individual
taste of the monarch, and so great
was the competition to produce something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
novel that very often the styles assumed a
grotesque aspect. The toes were elongated
so that sometimes they were carried up and
fastened by cords and tassels to the tops
of the shoes, and it finally became necessary
to enact a law to prevent such outrageous
types of footwear. The slippers of this
period were of the extremely high-heeled
variety, and small fortunes were often
spent on their ornamentation. They were
mostly of the turn-shoe type, and samples
which are preserved show the excellent
workmanship that was in vogue at that
time.</p>

<p>We now come to the first shoemaker in
America. When the <i>Mayflower</i> made the
second trip to America, she carried among
others a shoemaker named Thomas Beard,
who brought with him a supply of hides.
Seven years afterwards there arrived one
Phillip Kertland, a native of Buckinghamshire,
who settled in Lynn in 1636.</p>

<p>Kertland was the pioneer shoemaker of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
Lynn and for years he successfully worked
at his craft, teaching others his methods
and ways, so that fifteen years after his
arrival, Lynn was not only supplying the
requirements of its inhabitants, but was
also sending a part of its products to the
port of Boston. As early as 1648 we find
tanning and shoemaking mentioned as an
industry of the colony of Virginia, special
mention being made of the fact that a
planter named Matthews employed eight
shoemakers on his premises. Legal restraint
was placed on the cordwainer in
Connecticut in 1656, and in Rhode Island
in 1706, while in New York the business of
tanning and shoemaking is known to have
been firmly established previous to the
capitulation of the Province to England in
1664. In 1698 the industry was carried
on profitably in Philadelphia, and in 1721
the Colonial Legislature of Pennsylvania
passed an act regulating the material and
the prices of the boot and shoe industry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>Prior to 1815 most of the shoes were
hand sewed, a few having been copper
nailed. The heavier shoes were welted and
the lighter ones turned. This method of
manufacture was changed, about the year
1815, by the adoption of the wooden shoe
peg, which was invented in 1811 and soon
came into general use. Up to this time
little or no progress had been made in the
methods of manufacture. The shoemaker
sat on his bench, and with scarcely any
other instrument than a hammer, knife,
and wooden shoulder stick, cut, stitched,
hammered, and sewed until the shoe was
completed. Previous to the year 1845,
which marked the first successful application
of machinery to American shoemaking,
this industry was in the strictest sense a
hand process, and the young man who
chose it for his vocation was apprenticed for
seven years, during which time he was
taught every detail of the art. He was
instructed in the preparation of the insole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
and outsole, depending almost entirely
upon his eye for the proper proportions;
taught to prepare pegs and drive them,
for the pegged shoe was the common type
of footwear in the first half of the last
century; and familiarized himself with the
making of turned and welt shoes, which
have always been considered the highest
types of shoemaking, as they require exceptional
skill of the artisan in channeling the
insole and outsole by hand, rounding
the sole, sewing the welt, and stitching
the outsole. After having served his
apprenticeship, it was the custom for the
full-fledged shoemaker to start on what
was known as “whipping the cat,” which
meant traveling from town to town, living
with a family while making a year’s supply
of shoes for each member, then moving on
to fill engagements previously made.</p>

<p>The change from which has been evolved
our present factory system began in the latter
part of the 18th century, when a system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
sizes had been drafted, and shoemakers more
enterprising than their fellows gathered
about them groups of workmen, and took
upon themselves the dignity of manufacturers.</p>

<p>It was soon found that the master workman
could largely increase his income by
employing other men to do the work while
he directed their efforts, and this gradually
led to a division of the labor: the shoe
uppers, which had prior to this time been
sewed by men using waxed thread with
bristles, now were done by women, who
often took the work home.</p>

<p>One workman cut the leather, others
sewed the uppers, and still others fastened
uppers to soles, each workman handling
only one part in the process of manufacture.</p>

<p>We find that in the year 1795 the evolution
of the factory system had reached a
stage where in Lynn alone there were two
hundred master workmen, employing six
hundred journeymen and turning out three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
hundred thousand pairs of shoes per year.
The entire shoe was then made under one
roof, and generally from leather that was
tanned on the premises.</p>

<p>Factory buildings were not at this time
of a very pretentious nature and did not
by any means represent the amount of
work undertaken by the proprietor; for
the small ten by ten factories, which are
even to-day in existence in some of the
backyards of Lynn homes, came into
existence at this time. Many farmers
found that shoemaking was a remunerative
occupation in the winter, and they, and
perhaps their neighbors, gathered in these
shops and took from the different factories
shoes on which to fasten the soles, or
uppers to bind, which, after completion of
the work, were returned to the factory,
where they were finished and sent to market
packed in wooden boxes. It was in this
way that the industry prospered and developed
up to the period of the introduction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
of machines, which happened but a little
over half a century ago.</p>

<p>Up to the year 1811 absolutely no
machinery was used in the making of shoes.
This year shoe pegs were invented and a
machine for making them. The pegged
shoe became very widely worn, but it was
not until 1835 that any machine for driving
pegs was made, and even at this time the
machine was but an indifferent success.
It was a hand machine and its work was
by no means of a reliable nature.</p>

<p>The first machine to be widely accepted
by the trade was the “rolling machine.”
This was used for rolling the sole leather
under pressure, and it is said that a man
could perform in a minute with this machine
the same office that he would have required
half an hour to have performed with the
old-fashioned lapstone and hammer. This
was followed in 1848 by the most important
invention, the “sewing machine,” which
was perfected by Elias Howe, and was soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
followed by a machine which sewed with
waxed thread and made it possible to sew
the uppers of shoes in a much more rapid,
reliable, and satisfactory manner than had
ever been done by hand. This, too, was
soon followed by a machine which split the
sole leather and by another for buffing or
removing the grain.</p>

<p>In 1855 William F. Trowbridge, who was
a partner in the firm of F. Brigham &amp;
Company, of Feltonville, Massachusetts,
then a part of Marlboro, conceived the idea
of driving by horse power the machines then
in use. The introduction of power became
very general, so that in the year 1860 there
were scarcely any factories which were not
driven by either steam or water power.</p>

<p>The year 1858 was marked by the invention
by Lyman R. Blake of the McKay
sewing machine, which probably more than
any other has exerted a revolutionary effect
on the industry.</p>

<p>The McKay machine did not at this time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
sew the toe or heel; the sewing was started
at the shank and carried forward to a
point near the toe on one side, and the same
operation repeated on the other side; but
it seemed to possess great possibilities and
created a great deal of interest throughout
the trade. It was, of course, a very crude
machine and very different from the McKay
machine of to-day. It was set on a bench
and the shoe to be sewed was placed over
a horn, and the sewing was done from the
channel in the outsole through the sole
and insole. Colonel McKay immediately
started to improve the machine. He employed
skilled mechanics to work on it
and attempted to introduce it in different
factories, but encountered a great deal of
opposition and criticism in regard to its
future. It is said that he offered to dispose
of the machine to the shoemakers of Lynn
and allow them its exclusive use if they
would pay him three hundred thousand
dollars, an offer which was not accepted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<p>The machine left a loop stitch and a
ridge of thread on the inside of the shoe,
but it filled the great demand that existed
for sewed shoes, and many hundreds of
millions of pairs have been made by its use.</p>

<p>While Colonel McKay had met rebuff
and discouragement in attempting to introduce
his machine, the public necessity was
such that manufacturers were obliged to
take it up immediately; but Colonel McKay
was still embarrassed by lack of capital to
carry on his rapidly increasing business.
It was at this time that a system of placing
machines in factories, which system has
proven to be the most potent factor in the
upbuilding of the shoe industry, was started.
This was a royalty system, whereby the
machine or machine owner participated in
the profits accruing from the use of the
machine.</p>

<p>It hardly seems that there can be any
question as to the principle of royalty being
one of the greatest forces in building up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
the successful industry which we have
to-day; it afforded an easy means whereby
machines could be introduced without entailing
hardships on the manufacturers, who,
had they been obliged to pay the actual
worth of the machines, would have been
entirely unable to adopt them. Instances
are known where hundreds of thousands
of dollars were spent on machines, which
machines were abandoned without having
made a single shoe.</p>

<p>At the time of the introduction of the
McKay machine, inventors were busy in
other directions, and as a result, came the
introduction of the “cable nailing machine.”
This was provided with a cable of nails, the
head of one being joined to the point of
another; these the machines cut into
separate nails and drove automatically.
At about this time also was introduced the
“screw machine,” which formed a screw
from brass wire, forcing it into the leather
and cutting it off automatically. This was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
the prototype of the “rapid standard screw
machine,” which is a comparatively recent
invention, and is very widely used at the
present time as a sole fastener on the
heavier class of boots and shoes. Very
soon thereafter the attention of the trade
was attracted to the invention of a New
York mechanic for the sewing of soles.
The device was particularly intended for
the making of turn shoes and afterwards
became famous as the “Goodyear turn
shoe machine.”</p>

<p>Closely following the Goodyear invention
came the introduction of the first machine
used in connection with heeling,&mdash;a
machine which compressed the heel and
pricked holes for the nails; this was soon
followed by a machine which automatically
drove the nails, the heel having previously
been put in place and held by the guides on
the machine. Other improvements in heeling
machines followed with considerable
rapidity, and a machine came into use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
shortly afterwards which not only nailed
the heel, but which was also provided with
a hand trimmer, which the operator swung
round the heel, after nailing. From these
have been evolved the heeling machines
in use at the present time.</p>

<p>One of the early uses to which the sewing
machine was put was the sewing together
of the pieces of soft and pliable leather which
make the upper of a shoe&mdash;a simple thing,
involving only a slight adjustment of the
original machine. It is a far more complicated
operation to sew the upper to the
thick and heavy sole, and years passed by
before the secret was discovered, and the
McKay machine appeared. In the shoe
sewed on the McKay machine, the thread
ran through into the inside of the inner sole,
leaving a rasping ridge on which the stocking
of the wearer rubbed. The McKay shoe
displaced only the coarser grades. The
hand-sewed shoe remained the favorite
of wealth and fashion, and was worn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
exclusively by those who cared for comfort
and could afford the price. In sewing a
shoe by hand, a thin and narrow strip of
leather, called a welt, is first sewed to the
insole and upper, and the heavy outsole
is sewed to this welt, so that the stitches
come outside and do not touch the foot,
the insole being left entirely smooth. It
is a delicate operation by hand, and many
years elapsed before a machine was contrived
by which it could be done. At last
the problem was solved. The “Goodyear
welting and stitching machines” appeared&mdash;so
named for Charles Goodyear, who
financed and perfected them, a son of the
man who taught the world the use of rubber.
These two machines are the nucleus of the
Goodyear welt system, to which must be
attributed the revolution of an industry.
Although they are entirely distinct machines,
they are inseparable, for neither can be used
effectively without the other in making the
modern Goodyear welt shoe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span></p>

<p>Much of the style of a shoe depends upon
the wooden last over which the upper is
shaped before being attached to the sole.
To find a substitute for the human hand in
fitting the shoe to the last and pulling the
leather over its delicate lines and curves
seemed for a long time impossible.</p>

<p>This took place in the early seventies,
when a machine was invented for doing this
work. It created a great change in a department
of shoemaking which, prior to this
time, had been regarded as a confirmed hand
process. This machine, as well as those
which followed afterwards for a period of
twenty years, was known as the best type
of machine, by which the shoe upper was
drawn over the last by either friction or
pincers, and then tacked by use of a hand
tool.</p>

<p>At a comparatively recent period another
machine which revolutionized all previous
ideas in lasting was introduced. This
machine is generally in use at the present<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
time, and is known as the “consolidated
hand method lasting machine.” It was
fitted with pincers, which automatically
drew the leather round the last, at the same
time driving a tack which held it in place.
This machine has been so developed that
it is now used for the lasting of shoes of
every type, from the lowest and cheapest
to the highest grade, and it is a machine
that shows wonderful mechanical ingenuity.</p>

<p>The perfection of the lasting machine has
been followed recently by the introduction
of a machine which performs in a satisfactory
way the difficult process known as
“pulling over,” which consists of accurately
centering the shoe upper on the last and
securing it temporarily in position for the
work of lasting. The new machine, which
is known as the “hand-method pulling over
machine,” is provided with pincers, which
close automatically, gripping the shoe upper
at sides and toe. It is fitted with adjustments
by which the operator is enabled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
quickly center the shoe upper on the last,
and, on pressure of a foot lever, the machine
automatically draws the upper closely to
the last and secures it in position by tacks,
which are also driven by the machine. The
introduction of this machine marked a
radical change in the one important shoemaking
process that had up to this time
successfully withstood all attempts at
mechanical improvement.</p>

<p>At about the time that lasting was first
introduced, came the machines which were
used for finishing heel and fore part. These
machines were fitted with a tool, which was
heated by gas and which practically duplicated
the hand workman in rubbing the
edges with a hot tool for the purpose of
finishing them. From these early machines
have been evolved the “edge-setting machines”
which are in use at present.</p>

<p>Thus, one after another, every operation
has yielded to invention, until very recently
the only remaining process was subdued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
when a machine for cutting uppers was
devised. There are machines for shaping,
compressing, and nailing heels; for attaching
soles to uppers in heavy shoes by wooden
pegs or copper screws and wires; for rounding,
buffing, and polishing the soles; for
trimming and setting the edges of the sole;
for performing innumerable operations, some
seemingly trivial, but all essential to perfection
in comfort, durability or style;
so that in shoe factories to-day a greater
variety of intricate and expensive machines
is used than in factories of any
other kind.</p>

<p>At the present time the genius of the
American inventor has provided for every
detail of shoemaking, even the smallest
processes being performed by mechanical
devices of some kind. This has naturally
made the shoemaker of to-day a specialist,
who very seldom knows anything of shoemaking
apart from the particular process
in the performance of shoemaking of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
he is an adept, and from which he earns
a livelihood. The American shoe of to-day
is the standard production of the world.
It is in demand wherever shoes are worn.</p>

<p>In the year 1874 there had been perfected
not only the machines which Colonel
McKay and Mr. Goodyear had been instrumental
in building, but other inventors had
introduced similar machines for doing similar
work. This brought about the most
acute business competition, and finally
resulted in many cases where one machine
manufacturer alleged that the other machine
infringed his rights of patent, and in many
other cases the fiercest kind of litigation
was established. This had a most disastrous
effect upon shoe manufacturers, for
in many cases the manufacturer was made
to bear the brunt of the blows which
contending shoe machinery manufacturers
aimed at each other.</p>

<p>Machines in use in factories were stopped
by means of injunctions; damage suits were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
entered, and litigation was very general.
During the year 1899, there was ushered in
one of the most important events that ever
transpired in the history of shoemaking.
The most important of the concerns which
had been making war upon each other
were purchased by one large company and
brought under one harmonious management.</p>

<p>The United Shoe Machinery Company
owes its origin to a call for a change in conditions
menacing the industry of making shoes
which could not be ignored. It was created
by combining into one the three companies
existing in 1899: the Goodyear Sewing Machine
Company, the Consolidated &amp; McKay
Lasting Machine Company, and the McKay
Shoe Machinery Company, each of which
respectively made and leased machines
adapted to a particular class of operations.
The principal machines which each made
did not interfere with the principal machines
of any other. They were dependent links
in an industrial chain. The Goodyear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Sewing Machine Company chiefly made
machines for sewing the sole to the upper in
welt shoes and various auxiliary machines
which helped to complete the shoe; The
Consolidated &amp; McKay Lasting Machine
Company made machines for lasting a
shoe; The McKay Shoe Machinery Company
made various machines for attaching
soles and heels by metallic fastenings, and
furnished material for that purpose. A
single manufacturer, in order to make
Goodyear welt shoes, would be compelled
to patronize all the companies, going to
each of them for that part of his equipment
which it exclusively supplied. Each company
had its agents in factories looking
after its machines.</p>

<p>The gathering of these three companies
into a single organization wrought an instant
change. It resulted immediately in
greater economy of administration; in relieving
the manufacturer of the vexation of
sometimes seeing his factory crippled while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
orders were piling up; in freeing him from
the annoyance and expense of dealing with
several different concerns in order to get
his most important machines and keep
them in repair.</p>

<p>The attention which had been paid to
royalty machines and which had been such
an important factor in building up the
industry in America, was magnified by
the management of the new company.
Large forces of men and expert machinists,
as well as expert shoemakers, were maintained
in the different districts where shoes
were made, and every effort exerted to
promote the growth of the industry.</p>

<p>While the royalty system proved to be
of great advantage to small shoe manufacturers,
the largest manufacturers objected
to paying royalty on machines and desired
to purchase them outright. Being unable
to do so, they placed experts at work to
invent similar machines. This has resulted
in the United Shoe Machinery Company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
claiming that these machines are infringements
and causing considerable litigation.</p>

<p>If one reviews the history of the trade
during the past ten years, there will be
little question but that one will find it has
been a period of the greatest advancement
that the trade has ever known.</p>

<p>Within the time of those who read these
words, the way to make a shoe has been
completely changed. Methods which held
their own for centuries have disappeared,
to be replaced by processes which only recently
would have been thought impossible,
and which have brought within the reach
of men of modest means a luxury once
enjoyed exclusively by the well-to-do. The
feet of the million are clad to-day as finely
as the feet of yesterday’s millionaire. Shoes
marked by comfort, durability, and style
have driven to historical museums the stiff
and clumsy boots and brogans which not
so many years ago were worn by those who
could not pay to have shoes sewed by hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>The American people spend more than
three hundred million dollars every year
in buying shoes, and average three pairs
apiece, and yet few ever think about their
shoes so long as they do not look clumsy, or
wear out too quickly, or hurt the foot.
Every one likes to buy good shoes as
cheaply as he can, and every one likes to
feel that shoe manufacturers are independent
and successful, and that workmen get
good wages, because these things help along
prosperity; but that is all. Yet here is an
industry in which the United States within
a decade has come to lead the world, and
there are many things about it which it
would be worth while for every one to understand.
It is worth while, for instance, to
know that there is no important operation
on a shoe which need be done by hand;
that in the making of every good shoe no
less than fifty-eight different machines, and
sometimes twice that number, are brought
into play; that nearly all these machines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
are of American invention; and that they
have been so perfectly adjusted one to another
that they work together almost with
the precision of a watch; it is worth while
to know something about the marvelous
system under the encouragement of which
this typical American industry has blossomed
and borne fruit until it employs
two hundred million dollars of capital and
nearly two hundred thousand people, and
turns out two hundred and fifty million pairs
of shoes a year; and why it is that the
average man you meet to-day has a better
fitting, better wearing, and better looking
shoe than the moneyed man of yesterday&mdash;at
a fraction of the expense.</p>

<p>This remarkable growth is distinctly
American. In the United States the tendency
among the artisan class has been to
abandon the slow hand process. This tendency
has been as strong as the tendency
in Europe to adhere to it. Moreover,
there has developed among the laboring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
classes in the United States a mobility such
as is unknown elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>Another advantage which has contributed
to the rapid development of the manufacture
of shoes in the United States is the
comparative freedom from inherited and
overconservative ideas. This country has
entered upon its industrial development
unfettered by the old order of things, and
with a tendency on the part of the people
to seek the best and quickest way to
accomplish every object.</p>

<img src="images/illus41.jpg" width="650" height="420" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Stitching Room of a German Shoe Factory.</p>
</div>

<p>In all of the European countries in which
the manufacturing of shoes is an important
industry, the transition from the household
to the factory system was hampered by
guilds, elaborate national and local restrictions,
and by the national reluctance with
which a people accustomed for generations
to fixed methods of work, in which they
have acquired a large degree of skill, abandon
those methods for new ones. It was
natural, also, that in spite of the superior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
advantages of machine methods, hand process
of manufacture should still continue
side by side with them, in the European
countries, though machine work had long
since usurped the whole field of the shoe
industry in the United States.</p>

<p>As an American goes about among the
European shoe factories he is greatly surprised
at the state of affairs. He is struck
by three things which are very conspicuous.
They are: (1) Lack of use of machinery, lack
of all sorts of devices in order to save hand
labor, which is carried out so extensively in
the United States. (2) Lack of the division
of labor, one factory attempting to make
four or five kinds of shoes. (3) Lack of
methods employed for handling large quantities
of materials.</p>

<p>One point that is overlooked in considering
the shoe industries of the two countries
is the great difference in organization. In
most European factories, the manufacturer
gets all the orders of different kinds, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
then attempts to make one or two lines with
one or two qualities in the same factory.
In Switzerland one may find shoes and
slippers for men, women, and children made
under the same roof.</p>

<p>In the United States the manufacturer
makes a certain line of shoes in one factory,
and no other kind. If he has more than
one line, he has more than one factory, and
each factory turns out a distinct shoe for
a distinct purpose. The manufacturer has
his salesmen to sell these shoes.</p>

<p>The advantages of the American system
are: (1) The managers and workers of a
factory turning out a certain line of goods
become highly specialized in that line, and
can produce better results than the workers
in a factory attempting to make two or
three lines of goods. (2) A large shoe
factory is laid out as a rule to do a certain
kind of work, and it seldom changes. This
practice makes possible a greater production.
On the other hand we have something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
to learn from the European organization.
American manufacturers must meet the
foreign trade. In order to do this, the manufacturer
must cater to the habits, customs,
and climatic conditions. The European
manufacturer does this.</p>

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
